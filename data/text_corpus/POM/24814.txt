Hello, I am Matthew and I'm here to tell you about this 

DVD

Underworld, the two disc unrated extended

version and

if you haven't gotten this DVD previously

I would say go with this DVD. It has twenty-three minutes of bonus material 

of cut out footage versus the other DVD release of this movie

and it also includes a documentary of making of the movie and a forty-eight page booklet about 

the production of the movie. 

I found this movie, in general, very satisfying. It's the story line is between vampires and werewolves battling and it's got a very Gothic feel. It's not cheesy like other vampire movies. But it's 

got a very nice feel to it, and like I said, if you

haven't gotten this movie already, I would recommend this version.

But if you have gotten it, I really wouldn't recommend the upgrade. Saying it's only twenty-three minutes of bonus material.

This movie,

costs 

nineteen dollars at Wal Mart, and if you haven't seen it, I would highly recommend it.
