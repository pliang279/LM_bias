Alright, this is (uhh) 

not a bad pickup for a bargain movie. It's called The Wrong Guy, starring (uhh) David Foley of 

Kids in the Hall fame, that Canadian sketch show and Jennifer Tilly who was in, I believe, Bride of Chucky and a bunch of other films but that's the only one that comes to mind cause

they're not exactly the greatest actors and actresses in the world. David Foley was also the voice in the

Pixar film A Bug's Life which

is one of my favorite films, but unfortunately some people don't view it as the best, one of the best (stutter) better Pixar films, but {snort} what do they know? Anyways this is (uhh)

it's a comedy. 

I think it's a direct to DVD comedy. (uhh) It has some funny jokes in it that are alright. I give it two out five stars. If you see it on like (uhh) (umm) TV or something like that I'd say watch it. (umm) David Foley is pretty funny, the rest of the cast kind of (uhh).  

Otherwise two out of five stars as I said before and (uhh) he's accused of a murder, well he thinks he's accused of a murder that he didn't commit and it's basically him as a fugitive running away from people that aren't trying to chase him, although he does find the real killer. Two out five stars. {noise}
