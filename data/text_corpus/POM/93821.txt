Hi. I'm here to give you a video review of a terrible movie. 

Mission Impossible Two, starring Tom Cruise.

Now 

I I've (stutter) honestly found the entire Mission Impossible movie series 

has been somewhat lacking. The first one had a insanely convoluted plot and was just difficult to follow. 

The second one was probably the best out of all three, the third one was just terrible, not even worth mentioning. This one is a hundred and twenty-three minutes long, so it's pretty long, and it follows (uhh)

Tom Cruise's character as he tries to stop the deadly Chimera virus from attacking the world.  Now one thing I thought was pretty cool about this movie was the technology they used called the facemaker. 

(umm) It allows

the characters to make an exact copy of someone's face and then sneak in somewhere and then pull it off, 

and you never expect it until they actually pull it off. It looks really weird. (umm) But the actual movie has kind of a fun soundtrack, it was real popular at the time, had some of the more popular bands. It was really trying to jazz up the series for the teenage market I think. As you can see from the DVD cover here it's got motorcycles and fire which are two things that are are (stutter) fun in the movie, 

but the acting is terrible.

And honestly some of the action isn't as great as it could be. So

while this can be a a (stutter) slightly fun movie I would probably only give it a two out of five. So check it out if you're bored, but if you're not

don't bother. Go see the original Jurassic Park instead. Oh yeah.
