Okay, here I have 

the movie 

Bottle Rocket. 

This is a Nineteen ninety six adventure comedy drama. 

It is Wes Anderson's first feature film 

and it's also cowritten by Owen Wilson. 

(umm) Actually both the Wilson brothers star in this movie and it is their 

debut film. 

(umm) 

This movie is about best friends who decide to just (uhh) 

pursue life in crime. 

(umm) It's a pretty strange movie as most Wes Anderson movies are. 

But it's pretty funny. (umm) 

The New York Post called it an oddball project. (umm) 

I think that 

there's been mixed reviews 

(umm) as far as I know about this movie, so some people love it some people don't. 

I definitely think you should give it a chance if you're a Wes Anderson fan and 

you have to see his first movie. Or the 

Wilson brothers, definitely pick up this movie it's called

Bottle Rocket. It's 

something that I think you should pick up or at least have in your collection. 

It's kind of weird kind of quirky kind of crazy but, 

Bottle Rocket definitely just give it a chance.
