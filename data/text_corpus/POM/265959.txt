What's up, ExpoTV? I saw a movie called Don't You Don't Mess With the Zohan. (uhh) It's starring, I guess, Adam Sandler. And (uhh) you really don't want to even mess with this movie, to be completely honest. It was absolutely terrible, probably one of the worst movies I've ever seen in theaters. (uhh) It's it's it's (stutter) about how how (stutter) this guy, he's, like, this, like, secret agent, but he fakes his own death, and he moves to New York City and (uhh) he wants to be, like, a hair stylist, but then he also still has, like, his, like, spy skills, where he can, like, beat people up, like like (stutter) crazy, in crazy ways and stuff. (uhh) It's supposed to be, like, one of those, like, I guess outrageously funny movies, and it really, like, wasn't. The the (stutter) preview pretty much shows you what the whole movie is. (uhh) Like that trailer (uhh) he kicks people really weird that's, like, not realistic, like, he's supposed to be, like, this super super (stutter) agent, super hair stylist. And it's just like, kind of like making fun of, like (stutter), everyone, but it's, like, really stupid.

I I (stutter) thought that, like, Adam Sandler was starting to make better movies, but, like, he's definitely gotten worse and worse. (uhh) So I really would not bother with with (stutter) You Don't Mess With the Zohan at all, like, not even on DVD, absolutely nothing.

(uhh) I don't know where he got the idea for this,

but it really is absolutely terrible. (uhh) It has, like, the same cast as all his other movies, like, Rob Schneider, people like that. But, like but like (stutter) the story and the whole plot, it was just absolutely terrible. So (uhh) I would have to give You Don't Mess With the Zohan (uhh) one out of five. Do not see this movie. Please don't see it. You Don't Mess With Zohan, one out of five.
