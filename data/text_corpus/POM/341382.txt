Hi, today I'm doing a review on my (umm) favorite holiday film. (umm) This is the movie Elf

(umm) with Will Ferrell (umm) and it's just a great movie (umm) to watch. It's very funny. (umm) It's talking about a orphan who falls into Santa's bag and gets taken home with him (umm) back to Santa's workshop and (umm) an elf raises him and he's not an elf, he's a human and (umm) he (umm) grows up thinking that he is an elf and it's just a hilarious (umm) movie to watch. He comes back trying to find his real father and biological father and (umm) it's very funny to watch. So I highly recommend that you get Elf to watch during your holiday (umm) movie watching time and (umm) everyone will love it and they'll all have a good laugh and (umm) it's it's (stutter) just a great Christmas movie to watch, so I highly recommend you get it.
