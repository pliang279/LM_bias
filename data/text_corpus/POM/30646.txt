Hi, my name is Anesh and today I'm reviewing the DVD of the movie Gladiator.

Now Gladiator is a great movie. You know it stars Russell Crowe and Russell Crowe did a great acting there and

this movie actually won a lot of (uhh) Academy Award Awards (stutter).

(umm) Story is that Russell Crowe starts as a general but he's made a slave and then from the slave he becomes a gladiator and you know the whole story shows, (uhh) whole movie shows the courage and you know the determination that this guy has.

(uhh) Absolutely wonderful acting.

(uhh) You know five on five movie anytime.

(uhh) This DVD is a widescreen. 

(uhh) It has a lot of extras, specials,

(uhh) such as deleted scenes

(uhh) the documentary where this small kid played by played as Julius in there and 

(uhh) lots of extended scenes and commentaries and stuff like that.

(uhh) It's a a great great DVD for your collection. It has to be there.

(uhh) You know, if you like drama if you like fighting and you know blood and stuff like that.

(uhh) I love and I you know and I recommend you to buy it and

(uhh) keep it with you you (stutter) all the time.
