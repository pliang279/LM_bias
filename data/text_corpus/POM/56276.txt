Hey, how you doing? My name is Roger. I want to tell you a little bit about this 

(uhh) movie 

called the Master of Disguise. Now I will you that this is probably one of the biggest wastes of ninety minutes that I've ever done in my life. This is one of the most stupidest movies, 

(umm) 

and it was a complete (umm) 

insult for me to even watch it. It was that dumb. So I will tell you 

don't bother. If you see it keep walking by. Now Dana Carvey, I mean he's the, you know (stutter) it's, he's the main guy in the movie. Now I I (stutter) used to watch him on Saturday Night Live and, you know, it was funny. But in this movie he's a detective and he's in all, he goes in all kinds of different disguises to to to (stutter) do (umm) to to to (stutter) go after the bad guy, I can't remember exactly, I don't even remember why he's going after him. I just remember it was just so ridiculously stupid. (umm) I mean there's some stupid funny movies out there but this 

(umm) 

I mean it it (stutter) you had to have the maturity of maybe a five year old to really, really think this is a funny movie. So I will tell you

Dana Carvey's Master of Disguise, if you see it just keep right on going. It's not worth the ten dollars, it's not worth the five dollars. If someone gives you the movie it's not worth the time to even watch it. So don't even think about it, don't look at the name of it except the fact of saying ooh never get that movie. Okay, thanks.
