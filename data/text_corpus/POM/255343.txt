What's up Expo, I have a movie review for you, it's Step Up two the Streets. Came out February two thousand eight. It was directed by Jon by Jon Chu. Basically it's like the romance, but with like dancing involved.

(uhh) It doesn't have like the like like (stutter)

(uhh) Channing Tatum's not in it which pretty much made Step Up I cause like (uhh) because like the storyline was decent. But this one it's just like, not that good. People in it are like Robert Hoffman and other like people that I've never even heard of before. (uhh) I wasn't too impressed with the movie.

(uhh) It really really wasn't that good. It's It's (stutter) just like (uhh) like they go to the same school and like dancing brings them together. (uhh) But this sequel, not good. It's not a good sequel at all. I do not recommend seeing this movie. So I would have to give Step Up two the Streets a two out of five for this terrible sequel.
