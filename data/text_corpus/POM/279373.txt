Hey expotv, Eric here. What we've got is the Radiohead documentary, Meeting People Is Easy. It's a film by Grant Gee about Radiohead. (umm)

It's ninety-five minutes long and basically it covers Radiohead's OK Computer world tour. (uhh) So this came out in nineteen-ninety-eight, (umm) OK Computer came out in ninety-seven and this is probably the best documentary I've seen on Radiohead. (umm)

When I say documentary it's it's (stutter) kind a loose based documentary, (umm) it shows a lot of concert footage, (uhh) some behind the scenes work like like (stutter) before they go out to perform, various interviews here and there. So there's not a lot of (umm)

direct contact between the, the videographer or whatever and (uhh) the guys from Radiohead. It's just clips (umm) that were gathered around xxx this tour. (uhh) Nonetheless it's, it's (stutter) phenomenal. I, this is just an incredible documentary.  (umm) There are also a lot of new songs that you probably have never heard before (umm)

in this, and like there'll be some of the songs they just warm up with before they go out and play, (umm) and if you can kinda tell from,

from the video quality it's just like it's real kind of airy, it's just kind of kind of (stutter) cold. (umm) It just really sums up Radiohead and OK Computer really well, this documentary. And (umm) Stanley Donwood does all the

(uhh) artwork for it and this the (uhh) kind of disclaimer on it, says "this film contains (stutter) stroboscopic effects that adversely affect (stutter) epilepsy sufferers". So if you got epilepsy (uhh) be careful (uhh) to watch this movie, cause you know there's a lot of lights going on from the concerts and there's other things flashing in and out. (umm) There's also clips from some of the music videos they've done. So overall Meeting People Is Easy is a fantastic documentary on Radiohead.
