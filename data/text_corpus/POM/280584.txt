Hey guys, my name's Adam Lunsford and the product I'm talking about today is the DVD

The Bourne Supremacy starring Matt Damon. This is a really great movie. Hopefully you've been able to get into theaters and check out the newest one the last movie in this series, The Bourne Ultimatum which I absolutely loved. But this movie is the movie that started it all. It's really really good and just like the Bourne Ultimatum, nonstop action. Just like the other two the plot is super intense it will keep you on the edge of your seat. The fight scenes, the chase scenes, all the scenes in this movie are just awesome I love it. It's probably my favorite movie in this series. I really, really like it it kind of sets the foundation for the other two. It's a really good movie, if you haven't seen it, you don't have it it's a must have you gotta check this movie out. It's a great one to add to the collection and it's essential if you're gonna get the other two. I love this movie, one of my favorite action movies of all time, Matt Damon does an awesome job, it's just nonstop, action-packed really really really cool movie. Check it out, The Bourne Supremacy starring Matt Damon.
