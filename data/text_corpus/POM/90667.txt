Hi. 

Today I am reviewing the 

Walt Disney classic DVD special edition Beauty and the Beast.

(umm) This is the platinum edition. (umm)

It's some of (umm)

the world's favorite 

(umm) cartoon movie. 

(umm) It's totally awesome. (umm) I'm sure most of you have seen Beauty and the Beast

(umm) but this is awesome and it's a special edition. 

(umm) I really liked this because it was one of my favorite movies growing up,

(umm) as a kid growing up.

(umm) But yeah it's definitely awesome.

(umm) But yeah, it's really cool.

(umm) It has a lot of enhanced stuff.

(umm) It's three different versions of the movie on here.

(umm) They just kind of (uhh) I guess restored the

the old favorite that we all know and love.

(umm) But it's awesome.

(umm) It's a great story.

(umm) I'm sure most of you have seen it basically. 

(umm) It's about Belle and (uhh) basically she falls in love with the Beast. Which everyones pretty much scared of and stuff, but anyways.

(umm) But yeah, that's that (stutter) really sums it up, but it's great. Lots of fun characters. Everything comes to life and (uhh) just a wonderful movie.

(umm) Got this at Best Buy (umm) for twenty dollars. 

(umm) I give it five out of five stars definitely. You should go check it out. Walt Disney has plenty of great DVDs and I love how they're restoring 

(umm) the classics and what not. But I give it five out of five stars. So go check out the new platinum edition of Beauty and the Beast.

Oh, and this is for kids.

(umm) Kids and everyone can love it. It is rated G though. 

Thank you.
