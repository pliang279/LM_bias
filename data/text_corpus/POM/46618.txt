Hi, I'm reviewing the DVD release of (uhh), Python.  

(umm), If you've seen Lake Placid, or Anaconda, or any of those,

this is basically just a, 

a rip-off of those.  

And, (uhh), since it's ripping of a couple of pretty poor movies, 

it's probably no surprise that this one's even worse.  

(umm), The first thing going against it is that there stars Casper Van Dien, 

who in my opinion, has never been good in anything except for maybe Starship Troopers.  

(umm), There's no special features on the disc.  

(uhh) Which may be a blessing because once the movies over you wouldn't want to see anymore anyway.  

But, (uhh), this movie 

is basically about an hour and a half of (uhh), 

poorly done special effects. 

A computer generated snake 

chasing around (uhh) man and naked girls.  

I know that sounds good but (stutter) it's not.  

(umm) Basically this movie is not good, 

the DVD is not good, and (uhh), I have nothing good to say about it.
