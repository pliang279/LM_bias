Hi, I'm here to tell you about this movie that I happen to enjoy quite a bit. This is 

a movie that's based off of James Patterson's book Suzanne's Diary for Nicholas, the movie is entitled the same. (umm) this movie was made for

tv, this is a tv movie so you'll probably find it on Lifetime movie a lot. 

It's that kind of movie. (umm) 

It's a really great movie because it follows the book really well, and if you liked the book 

then you'll probably like this because it is pretty close and I've heard complaints from people that have read the book that they hated this, but 

I disagree. I 

liked the story more than the book itself and when I watched the movie I got the same story out of it than out the book so, 

really, I guess it just depends on who you are and what you got out of the story, but 

this is brand new, it just came out. You can get it for twenty dollars. I think it's

mainly on Amazon right now, but I'm sure it'll come to other video stores and 

Walmart pretty soon. But if you like James Patterson and you liked the book then 

I highly recommend this movie.
