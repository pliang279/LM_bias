Hey guys, Tina here and I want to do a review for you today of a movie that I just watched on DVD and the movie is called The Haunting, it's The Haunting of Molly Hartley. (uhh) This is a rated R movie on DVD, it's just recently released on DVD and there aren't any well known (uhh) actors in this movie, a lot of no names. I honestly can't name one character for you that I knew in this movie. Some of the faces looked familiar but (umm) not so much that I would be able to name them for you. It's basically (umm)

based on the haunting of a high school student (uhh) who's haunted by her mother. (umm) Apparently her mother tries to (uhh) kill her when she's younger and (umm)

it really haunts her in terms of psychologically. She has to see doctors and so forth. I think it's more of a a (stutter) teen flick more than anything because it revolves a lot of the, the (stutter) things are based in the high school where (uhh) Molly goes to school at. (umm) I watched it with my eleven year old daughter and she really enjoyed it, she likes scary movies, and it does have some scary points in it. I didn't really care for it, all I could say it's more of a a (stutter) teeny bop movie. (uhh) I would probably give it (uhh) I dunno, maybe a two out of five stars.
