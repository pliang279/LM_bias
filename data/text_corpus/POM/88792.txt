Elf is awesome. (uhh) I think this is one of my favorite

(uhh) Christmas movies, mainly because Will Ferrell's in it and he's a cool, funny man and I really respect his work. (umm) This here is the Infinite Film version (uhh) it has a bunch of special features in there. And 

{laugh} what's what's (stutter) there to say about Elf? I mean, look at the front. He's an elf. He's a grown man. (umm) The story basically starts off with a grown boy, well not grown, I guess you'd say human boy being dropped off at the north pole and trying to fit in with the elves and then eventually

the movie starts with him having to go find his real parents.

And then that's when it becomes hilarious because

he's an elf and he's in New York City I believe, is the city he goes to. {laugh} And you don't see elves in New York City walking around all the time. And (umm) 

yeah, I 

this is by far one of the most, like, like most (stutter) funny movies out there, (umm) Christmas time or not, and Will Ferrell does an amazing job. Even if he's carrying the movie (umm) there's also other stars like Zooey Deschanel and (umm) 

(uhh) Bob Newhart's his papa, and he he (stutter) does a good job, and his job is James Caan and (uhh) all kind of big names, kind of known, (umm) but yeah basically you should watch this movie, I give it a five out of five.
