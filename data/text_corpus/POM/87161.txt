Hi my name is Nalin and today I will be reviewing for you the movie Can't Hardly Wait. 

(umm) Can't Hardly Wait is a movie which starts out as a, 

in a, in a (stutter) high school graduation ceremony kind of a setting and (uhh) 

it starts out as everybody is discussing in the, 

in the (stutter) (uhh) ceremony that (uhh) 

Amanda was (uhh) 

dumped by a man named Mike Dexter. 

So Amanda is actually the 

homecoming queen and (uhh) 

Mike Dexter is the homecoming king. 

And (uhh) 

they were like the hot couple 

of the high school for four years and (uhh) 

that's where the whole hype about their breakup. So 

then it starts out that the guy, there's a guy who likes (uhh) 

the girl Amanda. (uhh) 

Who is the prom queen. 

So that guy other prom queen Amanda is played by Jennifer Love Hewitt and (uhh) 

the other guy who likes her a lot is played by Ethan Ambrey. 

(uhh) The movie on the whole is very average, I mean (uhh) 

there were very, very boring parts in the whole movie. 

Not very exciting stuff. (uhh) 

Not too much humor, 

very predictable and you can actually just figure out what's gonna happen in the end. So 

it's a very boring movie I would just rate it one out of five. 

(uhh) A special mention about (uhh) 

Ethan Ambrey's acting in the movie. 

It is horrible. (uhh) 

I mean I don't know what other kind of expressions he's given but 

he looks at 

I mean, many times he just looks like he's having (uhh) 

stomach problems so 

his acting is just horrible. 

But from that Jennifer Love Hewitt is the main reason I got the DVD to watch and (uhh) 

she's looking cute and (uhh) she's looking pretty good, so. 

I mean on that front I kind of liked the movie because she's just looking cute but 

the whole story I do not recommend that you watch the movie so 

that's all.
