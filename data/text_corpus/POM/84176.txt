Hey ExpoTV I'm Dea 

and something that I've mentioned so many times in so many different videos is that I love superhero movies. 

And I just like the cheese factor, the cheesier the better. 

That's how much I love them I'm like a big fan. 

(umm) And I've also mentioned that I do very few negative reviews, 

alas this is one of those 

and what's even worse is that it is about a superhero movie.

(umm) This right here is Hulk.

Okay, here's something that I have to tell you.

I will usually stick it out no matter what like, if I'm reading a book that I don't care for, I'll finish reading it anyway

just to get to the end and you know have an actual educated view of it. If I'm watching a movie

I'll stick it out until the end because you know, I want to see what happens maybe it redeems itself. This movie was so bad that I couldn't you know, I tried watching it to the end and I was like

this is awful on a level that I have previously not experienced in my existence. I mean like,

like Shazam with Shaquille O'Neal awful.

So as a person who like, you know I know a lot of people who are like, I don't, I don't (stutter) dig the superhero movies, they're too corny for me. I feel like as a person who loves the corn factor, if I didn't like it there's really something wrong.
