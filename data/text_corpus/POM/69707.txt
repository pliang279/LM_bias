Hi. This is my review of the movie Music and Lyrics.

(umm) 

I 

rented this the other day from Blockbuster and

(umm) my mom described this movie as cheesy 

to me 

and basically I would say that sums the movie up like

cheesy. It's just 

one of those really cheesy movies 

(umm) basically

(umm) Hugh Grant is this former like eighties pop star who was really popular in the eighties and 

(umm) they 

start doing some battle of the (uhh) 

like battle of the not bands but that kind of deal, battle of the pop stars from the eighties 

(umm) to kinda bring back some of the eighties stars 

and (umm) 

I guess in the process of that,

this like,

current

(umm) 

like a Britney Spears or 

(umm) 

(umm) that type of person basically (umm) is wanting Hugh Grant to write a song for her (umm) she actually has several 

like husband artists (umm) 

kind of competing to write a song for her and so

(umm) the only problem is that Hugh Grant 

is while he's a good singer and everything, he's not the one who always wrote the lyrics to the song, he had someone else in his band do that (umm) but the band, 

like he's not in speaking terms with the guy who normally write these lyrics so now he's in trouble because he can't write lyrics.

(umm) And then enter Drew Barrymore, his

(umm) actually apparently, this plant lady, she is hired to take care of his plants (umm) and so she, 

just happens to be this really awesome writer, she had written children's story or something like that 

and so, 

she (umm) writes, helps him write this song and 

(umm) of course (uhh)

pop star, the current pop star loves it and so, 

she uses it and blah blah blah and it's just really really cheesy. 

And of course because, 

you know, like all cheesy movies, these two fall in love, Drew Barrymore and Hugh Grant fall in love and

it's just a cheesy cheesy movie. 

I really don't recommend it 

unless you're just looking for a way to waste an hour and a half and then you know , 

you might like it but (umm) I was pretty disappointed in it, 

at least I knew going into it was going to be pretty cheesy because my mom had warned me so 

yeah I wasn't like oh really disappointed but still. (umm) So I would give this movie two out of five stars. 

So 

thank you.
