The Hills Have Eyes Two. I enjoyed The Hills Have Eyes, the remake that came out a couple years ago and (umm)

this is the sequel to it, of course. (umm) 

Going into the movie I knew the plot. You know, it's the hills have eyes, the first the one the family gets trapped, stays in the hills, 

(umm) which used to be, 

they used to test nuclear weapons there. Some of the people stayed, they killed the people, and that's what happens. So in this one it's (umm) 

the same premise, nuclear testing still going on the grounds. This time the army goes in there to test weapons and (umm) 

they go in there to to (stutter) do stuff, they have (umm) 

workers and stuff go in there, and (umm). 

So if you saw The Hills Have Eyes One you're probably thinking why not add soldiers? But (umm)  it was it was a bad movie. it wasn't the worst movie, and on a scale of one to ten I'd say it was probably a three. (umm)

But it was, it was (stutter) bad. I knew it was going to be bad. I wanted to see it just to see it. But I knew going in it was going to be bad and it wasn't as bad as I thought it was gonna be. (umm) 

It was still pretty bad, you know? Most of the people in the movie I didn't know. 

(umm) A couple of the people I did, I knew who they were, but (umm) 

it (stutter) was a very bad movie. (umm) Like I said, nuclear testing and then

the army goes in to to (stutter) do stuff and then 

most of them get killed. I mean, that's the premise of the movie and (umm) it's terrible, definitely stay away from it.
