Hi, I'm 

(uhh) reviewing the movie called 

(uhh) the Epic movie, which is currently in theaters and 

(umm) you know I've seen commercials on TV

and (uhh) it's basically a type of movie like Scary Movie, like the series where they make spoofs of everything, and 

(uhh) I've seen it on TV and

(uhh) it looked 

(uhh) pretty funny from the (stutter) from the previews that I saw.

(umm) I saw that over the weekend, did did (stutter) good in the box office. I think it got something like over twenty million dollars.

So (umm)

I decided to pay ten dollars, you know, go to the movie theater and see it and 

(uhh) gotta tell you that I'm extremely disappointed in the movie. 

(umm) For more than half of the movie, I didn't even laugh.

(umm) The only time I did laugh was at the the (stutter) pretty dirty stuff which they usually don't put in movies but, I mean that was pretty funny to me. 

(umm) there are a couple of rap music scenes from from BET, that were trying to make fun of, wasn't really funny. So 

(umm) this is not a very good parody movie and 

(uhh) I wouldn't recommend it at all.
