(umm) I am reviewing Undercover Blues. It's a really funny movie. It is PG-thirteen and it stars Kathleen Turner and Dennis Quaid. (umm) It's a very funny, funny movie. (umm) It's about (uhh) these, this couple who's Kathleen Turner and Dennis Quaid. (umm) They're married and they have a daughter. They are (umm)

kind of FBI agents. (umm) And they are actually

on, on (stutter) a leave I guess. (umm) And so they end up calling them in to kind of go undercover (umm) to find out about this (uhh)

crime person (umm)

who has stolen some bombs. (umm) And so they go undercover and with their little daughter there too. (umm) So it's a really funny movie. (umm) It's PG-Thirteen. I don't,

think this is (stutter) another movie I think that you can just look and judge (umm) it would probably be appropriate for some children so.
