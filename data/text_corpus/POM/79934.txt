Hi this is a movie that stars Kurt Russell and it's called Dark Blue, 

and (uhh) 

(umm) 

Kurt Russell kind of played, he plays a L.A. police (uhh) 

guy and (uhh) he's a mean guy. 

And (umm) he has a new (uhh) 

rookie that goes with him 

and (umm) he sort of teaches him the ropes. But in this movie, (umm) 

Kurt Russell he plays a kind of a 

bad character the cop is kind of mean. 

And (umm) 

but he's kind of showing the other guy the ropes, so. 

I I (stutter) didn't care for the movie because of the, 

I didn't like the storyline, 

and (uhh) 

at the end I think (uhh) you know it (stutter) at, the Rodney King (uhh) 

riot breaks out in the movie. 

And so there's a twist kind of a twist (stutter) at the end but I didn't care for it, I didn't like Kurt Russell in this role, 

and I didn't like the movie story and (uhh) 

so I, I (stutter) can't recommend this movie. 

So I wouldn't buy it but if you want to buy it you can go to amazon dot com and (uhh) this is a movie called Dark Blue.
