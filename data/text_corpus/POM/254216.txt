Hey there. {noise} I want to take a moment and do a DVD review for Disney's Underdog. (umm) This was a really funny film. It stars the voice talent of Jason Lee, (umm) from My Name is Earl, and it's cool because it's derived from

the original animated series, which, you know, maybe

some of you watched growing up like I did. But it's pretty funny. It's it's (stutter) got some really good humor, some good clean humor. And it's rated PG, and it's by Disney. And in this story you see how Underdog comes to be and he goes up against Barsinister and his henchman Cad. And it's it's (stutter) a really, it's really funny, you know, because you see where Barsinister is taking the DNA from animals, or humans, and injecting it into dogs trying to make them super beings. And he's wanting to

kind of make people

(uhh) obedient to him like a dog, it's his plot in this movie. But it was a pretty funny film. I enjoyed it, and I'm glad I own it. I can't wait to share it with my, my (stutter) daughter. I'm sure she'll enjoy it when she gets old enough. But (umm) it's it's (stutter) definitely a good film, and if you like Disney movies you'll definitely like this one. And this is Underdog.
