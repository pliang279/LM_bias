Hello I'm Matthew and I'm here to tell you about this (umm) great dvd.

This is A Christmas Story. (umm) This is probably (umm) everybody on the holiday season has seen this. (umm) It's millions and millions of people's favorite Christmas movie. And (umm) for a good reason, it's really really great. (umm) It tells the story around the holidays of a young boy in the (umm) forties or fifties, (umm) I'm not, I think the forties actually. (umm) And it is just really a classic. (umm)

It really doesn't have action and a whole bunch of stuff like that, but it's just in a great story. And this is the two disc special edition. (umm) It has two disc, like I said, and they're just cram packed. (umm) Full of bonus material.

So if you like the film, (umm) this is definitely the version to get. (umm) It has digitally remastered transfer (umm) of the movie it has interviews, it has making ofs, it has a photo gallery. Just tons and tons of stuff. You can buy this version for about fifteen dollars and I would highly recommend it.
