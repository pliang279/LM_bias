Hello and welcome to my review of Dig. 

A film by Ondi 

Timoner, I don't know if I said that right. But 

(umm) Ondi Timoner. 

(uhh) This is (umm) 

a documentary about two bands, 

the Dandy Warhols and the Brian Jonestown Massacre. 

Two (umm) 

(uhh) well they're, they're well known and in, in (stutter) some circles not so well known in others, 

(uhh) bands. (umm) This, it chronicles seven years of both band's lives. It, it (stutter) takes you 

(umm) it shows the rise of the Dandy Warhols and 

the (stutter) critical (umm) the commercial success that they (uhh) attained. And the 

critical success and 

(uhh) commercial fall of 

the (stutter) Brian Jonestown Massacre. 

(uhh) This is, 

this is an incredible film. 

(uhh) It won the (stutter) Grand Jury Prize at the Sundance film festival. 

(uhh) It (uhh) it just, it really gets in depth with the bands. (uhh) 

How they were once great friends and 

because of 

their successes and 

(uhh) failures they drew apart 

and nothing was really ever the same for them. (uhh) Because of (uhh) the music industry and their, 

just the personalities basically. 

(uhh) This is definitely worth checking out, it's packed with special, special (stutter) features it's a two disc 

(uhh) there's two discs, (uhh) there's videos, 

(uhh) commentaries,

(uhh) This is definitely 

a documentary to check out especially if you're a music fan whether you've heard of these bands or not. You should definitely see this movie,
