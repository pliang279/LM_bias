Remember when Nicolas Cage actually took interesting roles instead of just cheesy action roles where he got to exhibit absolutely no character or acting ability whatsoever? 

Yeah, I miss those days. The Wicker Man. A remake of a (uhh)

seventies (uhh) horror (uhh)

psychological thriller film

is no different from his other (uhh)

action films that he's done. 

It's just not up to par. The story line in this film

falls flat. I found myself actually rooting for the character's demise. (umm) 

It's more comical than serious. (uhh) The acting is about the same 

{clears throat}

Nicolas Cage serves up a big, hammy helping of his

balding, cheesy smile and attempt at charisma. Doesn't work. (uhh)

The only thing that really was interesting about this movie was the setting. It's set in a (uhh)

small island off the coast of Oregon where a cult is (uhh)

set up to (uhh)

basically (uhh) (uhh) where Nicolas Cage goes to investigate a missing child.

The scenes are really well done. The villages and the buildings have a very (uhh)

a very unique take on things and it's a really cool set. Other than that, horrible horrible movie.
