Hello, I'm Matthew and I'm here to tell you about this DVD movie. 

It came out in two thousand and five and it is called Birth. 

It stars Nicole Kidman. 

(umm) She plays a 

recently widow 

and then it jumps forward to ten years later 

and she is getting remarried. 

When a mysterious boy comes and pretends to be 

her husband reincarnated. 

(umm) 

The acting was okay. (umm) The directing was okay,

but 

I don't know if they were trying to make it (umm) sweet and romantic but 

it kind of comes off a little creepy, 

a little weird. 

(umm) The little boy is about eight or nine in it and she's about thirty, thirty-five. 

(umm) Late thirties and it comes off kind of creepy, there's (umm) 

(umm) a nude scene involving her and the young child and she's going to run away with him and 

(umm) they kiss in the movie and, 

and instead of coming off sweet and endearing it comes off a little (umm) 

weird and really creepy and a little uncomfortable. So (umm) 

I really don't know what Nicole Kidman was thinking but I would not recommend Birth.
