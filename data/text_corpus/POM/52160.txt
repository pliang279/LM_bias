This is the 

DVD Mars 

(uhh) it stars Olivier Gruner 

and Shari Belafonte. 

You've heard of Shari Belafonte but that's probably the only person you've ever heard of. 

The premise of it is that there is a (uhh) 

mining company on Mars and they pretty much (uhh) 

rule Mars 

(uhh) what they say goes 

(uhh) Olivier Gruner is a 

he's some xxx (uhh) 

signaled by his brother that he needs to come to Mars to help out 

cause he's in trouble (uhh) 

that's pretty much where this

this movie goes. This is what I would consider I guess a B B (stutter) movie, it's not, you know, it's not a top notch movie by no means. 

(uhh) 

Like I said, I don't know what else to say about it other than 

if you really like B movies, 

then you might like this one. 

But if you're looking for one that has any kind of (uhh) story
line, substances (uhh), 

actors in it or whatever,

(uhh) I don't think this is the movie that you, you know, you want to go rent.
