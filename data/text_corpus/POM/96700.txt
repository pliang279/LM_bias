This is Blade. This the original in a trilogy of movies

and (uhh) basically what it's about is that Wesley Snipes stars as the main character Blade and when he was (uhh) when his mother was pregnant with him she was bitten by a vampire so (uhh) while she had a baby I guess she was (umm) 

sometime about phasing into being a vampire but she (uhh), 

she ended up dying while giving birth and he ends up having (uhh) the powers of a vampire but (uhh) none of their weaknesses.

And so (stutter) refer to him as the daywalker and (uhh) xxx basically they just want to kill him, while one of the other guy probably just wants to (uhh)

use his blood for a ritual or something along those lines.

(umm) This is definitely one of my favorite action movies, I mean it's got so many awesome scenes, the atmosphere's just fantastic. The, I mean the the (stutter) fight scenes are choreographed just (uhh) ridiculously well. (umm) Wesley Snipes he just does such an amazing job at (uhh) playing the character. And (uhh) if you haven't seen any of the trilogy then I definitely recommend you start with this first. And I give this movie a very high rating, five out of five, and I I (stutter) definitely recommend it to anyone who hasn't seen it.
