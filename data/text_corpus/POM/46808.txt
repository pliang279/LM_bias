HI, I'm reviewing the DVD release of Romeo Must Die. It stars Jet Li and Aaliyah. It's a kung fu remake of Romeo and Juliet. (umm) I guess the big draw here was supposed to be the (uhh)

over the top action sequences. But to me, that's exactly what they were, over the top. (umm) It just became kind of silly

as you watch the movie. (umm)

the special features (uhh) there's a lot on here, but most of em seem like filler. There's thirteen behind the scenes documentaries, which seems like, about twelve too many.

There's three music videos as you can guess (uhh) because of Aaliyah being in here. And there's also (uhh) the trailers and some other stuff but

(uhh) they really don't save it. I really didn't care for the movie that much. (umm)

I thought that the action scenes were over the top and (uhh) the acting was terrible. I didn't really expect much, I mean a Jet Li movie, you just watch it for the fight scenes but I didn't really even enjoy those. So (uhh)

here you go.
