Seems that the majority of Americans hate their jobs.

(umm)

There are movies out there that explore this phenomenon but my personal favorite, Office Space. This is the special edition with flair. {cough} Office Space is based on a number of shorts by Mike Judge, who is famously known for creating (uhh) King of the Hill cartoon and Beavis and Butt-Head. (umm) Milton, the shorts that it's based off of, are of course based around one of the very minor characters in (umm) this film. In this, it's a typical computer programmer that works in an office, hates his job, hates his boss, and goes to counseling to (umm)

to help find what the problem is. Something goes wrong in the counseling and he ends up not caring about anything with his job. Dumps his girlfriend, and basically changes his life. And he's gasp, happy.

{cough} In it, Bill Lumberg, who (umm) is his boss, the character is absolutely hilarious, the entire movie is well put together, completely satirical, (umm)

every time that I go into work and something bad happens, even though I (stutter) don't hate my job, I think of Office Space. I quote it, and I even have the red swingline stapler famous from the movie.

Hate your job or not, pick this up.
