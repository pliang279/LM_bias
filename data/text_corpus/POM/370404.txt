I am going to talk to you today about The Lion King.

I took, my husband and I took the kids to see The Lion King. (umm) We had seen it originally (umm) when we were very young and, well I guess not so young. But (umm)

I hadn't seen it since I was a teenager and the kids were really asking to see it cause of the promotions they were giving on TV so we decided to go ahead and take them to see the movie. Well, I must say that the movie is better than I remembered it. It's about the lions and the different animals in the prideland.

And Simba, who is the King's son (umm) is forced to step up to be the king before he's ready. He ends up running away and the pridelands are nearly destroyed and he comes back to defend his family's honor and to restore the pridelands and serve as king. (umm) It has great music in it. They really remastered the color is wonderful. (umm) The kids so loved it and I loved it for them because I think it gave them

a lot of like, good life lessons about love and responsibility and overall I was very very very pleased with the movie. The kids really enjoyed it and I thought it was a good time. A good nice family movie. So I really do recommend if you haven't seen it yet, The Lion King. (umm) It has great, a great story to it plus it has good music. It's animated so it really keeps the kids entertained but it does have a good moral to the story. So I recommend The Lion King.
