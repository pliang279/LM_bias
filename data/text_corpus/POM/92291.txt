Hi, my name is Mary and today I'll be reviewing a movie that I recently saw in theaters and it's called Are We Done Yet? And (umm) this is part of the series

with Ice Cube. Anyways, Ice Cube plays this guy named Nick Persons who has just married the woman of his dreams, Suzanne, and

(umm) he wants to settle down so he

buys a quiet suburban house to escape, 

you know, the hustle and bustle of, 

you know, the city life. {clears throat}

And (umm)

and, 

you know, to open up space for his new wife and (stutter) kids, Lindsay and Kevin. But 

sadly what happens is that (umm) his house actually becomes very, very expensive to fix up and he has to deal with this like really weird, crazy 

contractor and

it's just a barrel of laughs. (umm) 

It's an hour and thirty-two minutes long so it's really not that long, but overall {laugh} it's just a really pointless movie. I just felt like all the jokes were not that funny, (umm) and there were some funny parts but really not, not (stutter) really. And (umm)

the acting was okay, but 

overall the plot was pretty bad. I just felt like we were going nowhere and 

basically I just really wanted it to end {laugh} so overall I would not recommend this movie. Alright, thanks.
