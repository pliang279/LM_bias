Hi, today I'm presenting 

a movie opinion on 

the movie Employee of the Month. 

(uhh) This movie is starring Dane Cook and Jessica Simpson. 

It also has Andy Dick in it. 

(umm) I would give this movie about a five out of ten. 

(umm) The acting wasn't any particularly very good and 

it wasn't very funny, it's supposed to be a comedy. 

I would say it's for (umm) people between the ages of about 

thirteen to twenty-five in that range. 

(umm) It had its moments but for the most part it's just one of those (umm) 

stupid comedies (umm) 

it's about a employee 

of this like, store who 

(umm) does slacks off a lot and (umm) 

this really pretty girl, Jessica Simpson, 

who moves to the store and he finds out that she really likes employees of the month. 

So he starts out working really hard trying to get employee of the month so he can 

win the girl. And 

so he runs and he also has an, an (stutter) enemy in the store who's also trying to get employee of the month 

and so they fight over the position. 

And so it's kind of entertaining but I wouldn't recommend watching it unless you're pretty bored. 

So, 

Employee of the Month.
