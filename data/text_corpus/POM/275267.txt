Hi there. I just returned from the theater and I saw this really really bad movie called
(umm) Beer for My Horses

and like I said, did I mention that it was bad? Well it was bad. It has Tom Skerrit in it, (uhh) that's not a reflection on him cause he's actually a good actor, it's got Toby Keith, who he's a country music singer and if you're listening to country music that's fine but he really shouldn't be acting, and it's also got (uhh) Ted Nugent. He's a former (umm)

rock singer or whatever but he's not really an actor either. So I mean you're you're (stutter) putting these people together to make this really bad movie and I guess that's what you're gonna get. It's rated PG-thirteen. The premise of it is there's these two deputies that are trying to do something. The sheriff doesn't really want them to do it but they do it anyway. So they take this road trip and

that's kind of how the movie goes. and like I said, you watch it for yourself and see what you think. I mean I wouldn't recommend you watch it, cause it was bad enough that I watched it one time. (uhh) I wouldn't see it at the theater and I wouldn't rent it either. I'd just try to forget about it. (uhh) Kinda like it was a bad dream, you know. Just forget it had ever happened. But (umm) that's my opinion anyway. Like I said, Beer For My Horses is the title and (uhh) it's one that you should just (uhh) omit from your mind.
