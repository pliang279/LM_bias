Hello, and today I'm going to review the movie Borat, currently in theaters.

I'm sure most of you have already heard about this movie and perhaps seen the previews for it. And (uhh) the previews, 

and oftentimes for movies the previews show the most important parts and the most interesting parts of the movie and then the rest of the movie's pretty boring, but in this one they don't (uhh) do the movie justice. 

(uhh) The movie is first of all it's hilarious, there's many many great scenes. (uhh) The actor in it is Sacha Baron Cohen and he does other popular (stutter) shows such as Ali G, 

which (uhh) mostly plays in the UK. 

And (uhh) this movie does have a lot of crude humor so it is definitely not for (uhh) children, and maybe not even teenagers without parental supervision. There is (uhh) nudity of sorts, and definitely obscene language and obscene scenes,

 but overall it's a hilarious movie with a lot of funny parts. The only real problem I see with it is that (uhh) perhaps it goes a little too far when it makes fun of people, and makes fun of cultures. (uhh) 

I think it goes a little too far in some of those aspects and (umm) might not (stutter) have good humor but sometimes too offensive. Like I said, overall it's a great movie, it's hilarious, I enjoyed it a lot. I highly recommend anyone who's seen Sacha Baron Cohen's previous work and I also recommend it for people who haven't seen it because, like I said, it's it's (stutter) a great movie. (uhh) Just don't bring your children to it because, like I said, there are some obscene parts. 

Once again it's called (uhh) Borat and (uhh) the name's actually pretty long but 

the main important part of it is Borat.
