Hi my name is Kristen and this is my review of 

The Right Stuff. 

(umm) This is the two disc, 

two disc special edition. 

This movie actually came out back in the early eighties. 

(uhh) nineteen eighty three to be exact. 

I guess it's like a real classic but you know, 

we'd never heard of it, so. {laughter} 

But yeah I mean I guess I've heard of it I'd just never seen it. 

(umm) It's about the space program and how it developed 

and (umm) 

it talk, you know it begins with Chuck Yeager who is a test pilot, 

and he wants to break the sound barrier. 

And just kind of goes on and shows the training and what was involved could be with becoming one of the first astronauts. 

I have to say I really enjoyed this movie. 

(umm) 

It's just, it's a really fun movie. You know it's got like Dennis Quaid in it when he was really young 

and 

let's see and what else that you might know. 

(umm) Ed Harris you know people like that and, 

it's it's (stutter) really, really fun and informative. (umm) 

It has some fun special features on it. 

It has a profile about John Glenn. 

And (umm) 

a few other documentaries about the making of it. 

But yeah if you're looking for a great gift and you have a friend that's really into space 

I would definitely recommend this movie. 

There you go.
