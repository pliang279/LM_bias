Hello, I'm Ally and I'm here to tell you about this fabulous cartoon. 

It is now on DVD which 

is very exciting for many Garfield fans. This is 

Garfield As Himself, 

starring Garfield. 

(umm) By the famous Jim Davis who 

has done these 

classic comics for many many years now. 

(umm) This is great because you get three of the episodes 

just on this DVD. 

(umm) The runtime 

is about seventy-three minutes of just pure Garfield. 

The three episodes are Here Comes Garfield, where he

has to save Odie from 

(umm) their neighbor. 

(umm) Garfield On the Town, where he just 

roams around, he meets his long lost mother. 

And Garfield Gets A Life, where 

he just gets a life. 

(umm) This is a great classic cartoon. 

(umm) The fat cat is really entertaining. 

He's really funny, 

a very dry sense of humor, he picks on Odie. (umm)

John has to rescue Odie and get onto Garfield and feed him his lasagna. 

(umm) If you're a Garfield fan you'll love this I really found it worthy of a purchase. 

It's about nine dollars and you can get it anywhere and I highly recommend it.
