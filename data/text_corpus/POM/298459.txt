Public Enemies. (umm) It's a movie I saw last week, it's got (uhh) Johnny Depp and Christian Bale in it. It was really good. It's the story of (umm)

John Dillinger. (uhh) He was a criminal bank robber in the nineteen-thirties.

And it sort of just follows his story (umm)

after he got out of jail for the first time and it's just really interesting. There's a lot of action, there's a lot of suspense, (umm) and it's like really, it's really well done. The filming (umm)

I liked it a lot, I don't know what else I can say about it. (umm) It's pretty long, it's about two and a half hours long, maybe a little too long. But, you know, it was good. (umm) so if you're looking for a good movie to go see check out Public Enemies. (umm) It's in theaters now.
