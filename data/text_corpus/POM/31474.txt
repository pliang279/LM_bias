Hello, I'm Matthew and I'm here to give 

you my review on 

this DVD movie called The Feeding. 

It came out in two thousand six and it was directed by Paul Moore. 

Besides that I can't tell you the rest of the cast, it really has a bunch of nobodies in it. 

(umm) 

The storyline is a bunch of college students go camping in the woods and there is a werewolf which is chasing them. 

This is definitely an independent film. 

How it got made I don't know. 

This movie 

was quite possibly the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. 

But almost to a point that was very funny. 

It was shot on a very low budget. 

It was shot really kind of grainy. 

The acting was horrible in it. 

Almost like they were reading cue cards. 

The werewolf costume was completely unbelievable. 

And 

it also had a person in it who kept 

shooting the wrong, missing the werewolf when it shot at it and (stutter) shooting the college kids. So she ended up killing about four of them because she was such a bad shot. 

This movie, 

how it got made I don't know. 

How it got released on DVD I don't know, 

but it was quite comical to watch and 

on a scale of one to ten I would probably give it a one. 

If you're in for a good laugh, I would go pick it up but I would definitely stay away from it if you like serious good movies.
