Hey again guys. 

xxx I am reviewing today is the movie Team America World Police,

specifically this is the censored and unrated version. (umm) 

The team who made this is the team (uhh) xxx parker.

(uhh) They were the mind behind South Park, a very popular television show.

And also (umm) the movie xxx,

not so good but (umm) 

I guess they should really stick to TV because this isn't that good of a movie.  

(umm) It's all about puppets

(umm) sort of the like parody of the old seventies puppet television shows, (umm)

but it is not that good 

it (uhh) 

it tries to be kind of (uhh) sexy 

and (uhh) taken into account like political themes like Kim Jong Eun 

(umm) is the bad guy and (uhh) there's a bunch of like (uhh) 

celebrities in it who would team up with him because they are like super liberal celebrities.

The plots kind of (stutter) but I mean puppets so what do you want. 

(umm) 

There are a few funny scenes I guess, most revolves around haha puppets 

but, I can't recommend this movie, it's not that good, two out of five.
