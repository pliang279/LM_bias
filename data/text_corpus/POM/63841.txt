Hi, I'm gonna talk about the movie called Three Hundred which has been a hit in (uhh) movie theaters recently. 

(umm) This movie is just really amazing, it's it's (stutter) about the conflicts between Athens and Sparta back in the days. 

(umm) I've actually recently taken taken (stutter) a Greek civilizations class and 

one of the interesting things I found was that 

though the storyline (uhh) is not very accurate and everything, 

the weapons actually are very, very accurate and because it is a movie with a lot of fighting and everything, it's (umm) 

really interesting to see that 

(umm) this some of it was actually (uhh) really true. But other than that 

it's really, really an exciting movie it's just all this fighting and three hundred against a thousand and 

so many different things and it's just got some classic lines in there it's really a boy movie actually though. 

(uhh) All the guys I know like actually love that movie but 

(umm) it's not really girl movie it's just got a lot of violence not much of a plot but it's just love the movie it's just a really good movie (umm) I definitely would recommend it 

(uhh) to everybody who likes this sort of thing and who's heard of it and who thinks it's interesting. It's definitely worth it. (umm) 

I definitely say, suggest you go out to theaters right now and (uhh) watch that movie.
