Hey there. Summer here and if you're looking for a fantastic DVD at a value price that everyone in your family can watch, well why not try Pay It Forward, with Haley Joel Osment, Helen Hunt, and Kevin Spacey? This movie takes you through the journey of a child who learns life's lessons and it might just leave you crying in the end. Now I purchased this DVD for a little under ten dollars so it's a great value to add to your DVD collection. But, word of caution. The movie is PG thirteen for some mature thematic elements including substance abuse and recovery, some sexual situations, language, and brief violence. But

let me tell you for your older kids you can learn a lesson from this like none other. According to the movie it's a simple story line. Haley Joel Osment has a teacher, Kevin Spacey, and a mom, Helen Hunt. The teacher gives him a lesson. Let's change the world. And he does. The process of the movie takes you through how he changed the world and how it comes from his small town to change people's lives all the way across the country. This movie truly teaches you that one person can make a difference. So why not buy Pay It Forward, add it to your collection and teach your kids a life lesson that you can change the world?
