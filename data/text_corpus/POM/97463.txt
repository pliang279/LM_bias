Hey y'all, how's it going? My name is Jordan and (uhh) today I'm going to be reviewing The Bourne Supremacy. Now (uhh) The Bourne Identity was actually the first movie in this (uhh),

in this series and this is the second movie, The Bourne Supremacy. And (umm) this is a pretty good movie, however I didn't really enjoy it as much as the first one. (umm) The first one I didn't really know what to expect. (umm) It had a lot of cool fighting and stuff like that. I mean it was really, you know, new and it was it was (stutter) cool to watch. I mean, now this movie is really cool to watch and it has a lot of interesting (umm)

fight sequences and stuff like that but the it just didn't have that pop that the first one had. (umm) It also didn't have that really crazy car chase that they had in the first one. But (uhh) but this is a pretty good movie. (umm) It definitely picks up, you know, where it left off and (umm) you're definitely going to want to see this before the new (uhh) movie comes out which will be The Bourne Ultimatum which doesn't come out until the end of this year, which 

(uhh) which will be about winter two-thousand-seven, just in case somebody's watching this (umm)

and it's after that date. But (uhh) but yeah, so this is a really great DVD. I would (stutter) definitely recommend that you pick this up. (umm) It has a good bit of special features because they did (umm) do a lot with (uhh)

with Matt Damon, and teaching him how to fight and stuff like that and it's really cool how they did that. So I definitely recommend you get that. (umm) Get this DVD just so you can see that. But (uhh) but yeah, I (stutter) definitely recommend that you pick this up. It's called The Bourne Supremacy. (umm) I think you'd enjoy it, it's a really great DVD to add to your collection.
