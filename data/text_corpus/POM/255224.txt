Hi, I'm Mike with expotv and this is my movie review of College Road Trip, which was a complete utter waste of time. (umm) Ever since the American Pie movies came out around ten years ago (uhh) people have been coming up with movies like Road Trip and College Road Trip, all this type of (uhh) different stuff. Well this one basically stars (uhh) Martin Lawrence and he's reconnecting with his daughter who's getting ready to go to college. (uhh) And because Martin Lawrence is in it (uhh) it's kind of funny because he's he's (stutter) a seasoned, funny, professional guy (uhh) but the movie is just watered down. It's got that (uhh) really awful RV meets Are We There Yet type of vibe to it where it's so family oriented, it has such, such (stutter) moments every five or ten minutes of just unfunny stupidity that it's just a real challenge to enjoy. (umm)

I would say I can't really think of anybody that might (uhh) enjoy the movie. (uhh)

If if (stutter) you were sleeping or comatose in the film you might enjoy it. (uhh) If you were in the bathroom during the whole film (stutter), you know, you might like it too but if you're forced to watch it then you're pretty much not gonna enjoy it at all. (umm)

I definitely think Martin Lawrence needs to go back to some other funny things. (uhh) It's kind of sad but, you know, you probably thought a year or two ago when you saw (uhh), if you did see, Wild Hogs you'd probably think "well wow, he can't get any lower" but he actually did. (uhh) So maybe he needs to go back and do Wild Hogs Two or just do something to get his career back on track, but but (stutter) this is just a big mess. (umm) I'm Mike with expotv and I thank you for your time.
