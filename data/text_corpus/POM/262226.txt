ExpoTV, let's talk about Tyler Perry's Meet the Browns. All right? First of all, Tyler Perry, quit making stuff. Quit making TV shows. You're not funny. No one thinks you're funny. It's stupid. Let me tell you why. All right?

Now, the premise of the movie, Meet the Browns, is extremely stupid. I highly recommend going to see anything except for this movie. All right? The acting was not that good. The writing even wasn't that good. All right? All right, now, all right, the acting was okay, but the writing wasn't good, and there's nothing new about the screen shots, the cinematography. All right? There's, like, no reason to see it. There is not one reason to see this movie. In my opinion, I think you could spend your money and, more importantly, your time elsewhere or in a different (stutter) movie in the theater, or don't even go to movies. Go do something else, because this movie is not good. All right?

Seriously, whoever cast this movie, not good. And Tyler Perry, this is a message from me to you. Do not make movies, because they're not good. Everyone on ExpoTV, please do not see this movie. It's not worth your time. I highly recommend going to see something else.
