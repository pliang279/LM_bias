Hello expo, this is Negative King and today I'm going to be telling you (uhh) one of my favorite gifts I got for Christmas, and that was my Inception Blu-ray DVD digital copy combo pack. (umm) First off I'm going to say that (uhh) this is one of my favorite movies ever, (uhh) directed by (uhh) Christopher Nolan. (umm) It stars (stutter) Leonardo DiCaprio, Ellen Page, (umm)

Joseph Gordon-Levitt and (uhh)

they're pretty cool actors. (umm) also Cillian Murphy

(umm) who's also in the Dark Knight movies. (umm) Which Christopher Nolan also directed. (umm) It was also the last movie that (umm) Pete (uhh),

what's his last name, Pete Postlethwaite (umm)

starred in after he died a few days ago. (uhh) He was one of my favorite actors so a tragic loss and this a great movie to buy to honor him. (umm)

Let me go ahead and say that (umm)

if you get this combo pack (umm)

it covers about everything that you need as far as on your Blu-ray player, DVD player, or on your computer with your digital copy. (umm)

So you get a whole bunch of bonus features on each disc and (uhh) with this little sticker on the front you take a photo with it with your cell phone and you send it to a number and it unlocks special features (umm) such as a digital comic book on the menu after you type in a certain number, which you get from the text message. (umm) Some really interesting stuff here, and (uhh)

so you get all these bonus features on top of the movie which itself is worth it because it's one of the best movies I've seen in ages. (umm)

I highly recommend it. (umm)

If you can't afford this you can get the (uhh) just the DVD or just the Blu-ray. (umm)

Go out and get it.
