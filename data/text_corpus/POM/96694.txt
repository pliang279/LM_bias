Okay I didn't think you could get much worse than Mortal Kombat when it comes to bad kung fu movies, but Romeo Must Die really wins the prize.

This is starring Jet Li and Aaliyah 

(umm) about a 

(uhh) a guy, Jet Li, who is trying to win the girl, Aaliyah. It's a pretty standard story and of course he has to deal with all these thugs along the way and it's just terrible. I mean the the (stutter) fighting is fun but the actual dialogue is awful. There's no plot, I mean I could have come up with something better than this. 

And the cinematography just isn't all that great either and

the DVD itself right here isn't

too bad. I mean it's got a lot of special features for a DVD. It's got three music videos and a behind the scenes (umm) segment and all that. So that's definitely a plus. 

But, other than that, I mean what good are special features when the movie itself is terrible?

So, for that I would give this movie a one out of five. It just really didn't do it. I left the theater

just completely disappointed. I don't know why I bought the DVD. I mean I guess it was it was (stutter) real cheap

at the Blockbuster so I just picked it up for laughs. But don't watch this unless you wanna watch a bad movie on purpose.

Romeo Must Die, with Jet Li and Aaliyah. 

Bad news. 

Good night.
