This is Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest. 

This is the second 

movie in the Pirates trilogy now. 

(uhh) It stars Johnny Depp, Orland (stutter) Bloom and Keira Knightley. 

(uhh) This continues the tale of captain Jack Sparrow 

and Will Turner. 

(uhh) They meet some very new interesting (stutter) characters 

in this edition. 

So if I'd recommend that if you've seen the first one and you enjoyed it then you probably will also like the second one. 

So you should check it out, especially now that the third one is coming out on the movie. 

So you should probably see this before you see that. 

This movie is rated (uhh) PG-thirteen,

so it may be a little

(uhh) advanced for some young children.

But that is your decision.

This movie was made by Walt Disney Pictures, so if you like Disney movies, especially if you're a little older and you still want to see a good Disney movie,

then Pirates of the Caribbean is a good choice for you.

So if you have seen the first one, then you should check out Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest.
