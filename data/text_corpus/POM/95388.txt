Hi, today I'd like to review The Forgotten on DVD.

This is a thriller slash

sci-fi movie starring Julianne Moore

and it's about a woman whose son disappears one day 

and 

and 

everyone claims that her son never even existed

but you know she knows in her heart that he did exist. But overall, 

it's a pretty bad movie.

(umm) It's predictable, cliched, I mean Julianne Moore is a great actress and she's good in this but

I think she can definitely find better work.

(umm) So overall I don't really recommend the movie. The DVD has some good special features though like

deleted scenes, an alternate ending,

(umm) audio commentary,

making of documentaries

so there's some good stuff there but 

the movie's too bad for me to recommend fully.

(umm) Except for maybe as just a really mindless diversion

like 

a weekend evening or something.

Okay, and that's my review of The Forgotten on DVD.
