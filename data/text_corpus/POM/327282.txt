So this is a movie review on Salt, starring Angelina Jolie. (umm) {cough} 

First of all, I have to say that I was very, very excited to see this movie. (umm) Ever since I'd seen the previews I just really wanted to see it. And

I wasn't disappointed at all. (umm) I went to see it with a good friend of mine, and the preview leads you to believe that the movie is about

just Angelina or Salt being (uhh)

being chased and accused of being a accused of being a (stutter) Russian spy, but it's really a lot more to the movie than just that. I don't want to spoil the movie for you in case you haven't seen it. But let me just tell you there are so many unexpected twists to this plot. (umm) I think Angelina does an exceptional job portraying Salt. (umm) Her emotion is shown so well,

and all the actors do, do (stutter) an amazing job really.

My only problem with this movie was

the ending was a bit unsatisfying to me because I wanted to see what was going to happen next. But

I mean it was a great movie, it's definitely worth seeing. (umm)

I'm definitely going to buy this movie and watch it again and show it to other people it was just that good. (umm) I'm a big Angelina Jolie fan and she definitely did not disappoint with this one.
