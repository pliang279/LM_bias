{noise} Hi there and welcome to my review of the nineteen-sixty-one best picture of the year, West Side Story. This is the DVD collector's set. (umm) Like I said this film came out in nineteen-sixty-one and is not even rated but it's definitely suitable for all audiences and one of my favorite films. The (uhh) two disc edition is actually kind of nice. It comes with, it comes in that little case there. (umm) It comes with this book here which is has (uhh) the entire script including the lyrics to the songs, which is kind of nice. (umm) As well as (umm) two discs of (uhh) many special features. (umm)

This (stutter) or this (uhh) movie is also a musical which I kind of enjoy and find myself singing along. (umm) I have seen this show many times in my career {laugh} and it involves kind of a modern day Romeo and Juliette as (umm)

Maria and Tony are from different gangs, the Jets and the Sharks. (umm) Puerto Rican gangs in New York City and (umm) kind of absurd romance ensues and (umm) I don't know, the interaction between the two gangs cause they're from the different side of the tracks. So I recommend that you buy the two (stutter) disc edition of West Side Story.
