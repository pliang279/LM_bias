Hi, this is Dan with my review of Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. This one by far is my favorite of the Indiana Jones trilogy and it (stutter) introduces a new character, (umm) Sean Connery, Indy's dad and 

(umm) by far the (stutter) best written

(umm) script of the three Indiana Jones' in my opinion. The Last Crusade details 

(umm) Indy's quest for the Holy Grail, the chalice that reportedly Jesus drank out of that will bring immortal life.

(umm) It is a little farfetched, but this one's well played.

(umm) and I felt that this was the best written of the three Indiana Jones movies.

(umm) This is a great film. It's safe for the family, I believe it's rated PG and 

(umm) it is rated PG-thirteen. There is some violence now that I do remember that involves a little bit of 

(uhh) gore. People's heads being decapitated rolling around and what not. Definitely touching experience, 

(umm) as there's more dramatic elements in this movie. As well as the same 

(uhh) humor and also action found on the frequent (umm) Indiana Jones adventures.

(uhh) Definitely not one to miss, I would highly recommend it and this is Dan with my review of Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade.
