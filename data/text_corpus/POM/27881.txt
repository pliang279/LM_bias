This movie is The Sleeping Dictionary that I'm reviewing. It is rated R there is nudity and language, violence. (umm) Not appropriate for children. It stars Jessica Alba.

(umm)

And this movie (umm) is about an Englishman who goes into (umm) the jungle I guess (umm) they're in there and

in order for him to learn the native language, what they usually do is have one of the females live with the Englishman. (umm)

Kinda as their lover type thing. So they teach him how to speak the language. (umm) He ends up falling in love with the girl. (umm) Which is a major no-no. So the story is kind of, it's a definitely a love story. (umm) About what they do in the obstacles they have in trying to get together. (umm)

It's a pretty good movie. (umm) Not appropriate kids again like I said. And that is The Sleeping Dictionary.
