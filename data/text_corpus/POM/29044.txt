Hey y'all, how's it going? My name is Jordan and (uhh) today I'm going to be reviewing the DVD Spy Game.  Now this had Brad Pitt in it, the movie itself had Brad Pitt in it, and Robert Redford and (umm) 

when I watched this movie I thought it was boring. (umm) 

I, when I went into it I was thinking it was going to be, you know, this big action movie. I mean on the front it has this explosion and, you know, it has all this helicopter and the men moving and everything. But really it's not that action packed at all. It's (uhh) more of a drama kind of movie, and I didn't really get into it at all because I was expecting it to be this huge elaborate, you know, action movie where, you know, stuff blew up and people were shooting and stuff like that, but that that (stutter) wasn't this at all. (umm) It was really more of a psychological drama kind of movie. It really didn't have that much action. So (umm) I don't think I'd really recommend this movie, it's not really that great. So the movie's not that good so I guess y'all should probably stay away from it. (umm)

Special features wise there's a good bit of special features but I just didn't care to see them because I didn't like the movie, so I didn't really care about the special features also, but (umm)

in the in the (stutter) special features they have (uhh) a documentary on how they created some of the (uhh) some of the limited action scenes that they did. You know, there's only a few, but the ones that they did they explained them. 

But (umm) other than that I think there's a commentary and theatrical trailer but that's about it. So (umm) really I wouldn't recommend this one, I don't, I don't think this was a really good movie so it's really not worth purchasing. If you must see it though definitely go rent it first. But (umm) but yeah that that's (stutter) about it. This is Spy Game and (uhh) you probably want to skip over this one.
