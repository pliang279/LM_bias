Hello, I'm Matthew and I'm here to tell you about this great DVD. It's called Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. It stars Jim Carrey, Kate Winslet, Kirsten Dunst, Mark Ruffalo, and Elijah Wood. (umm) It really has an all-star cast and the story and directing is amazing. (umm) It basically tells the story of a man that breaks up with his girlfriend

and there is a new machine that can erase your memory of someone, and he decides to forget about his girlfriend. Well to erase his memory he has to live through the memories he had for it to erase. So he finds out that he really doesn't want to break up with his girlfriend. (umm) He really did love her, and he's trying everything he can to not,

to hide from his memories so (umm) he can remember her and date her again. (umm) It's a very serious role for Jim Carrey (umm) and he does it perfectly, and it also has lots of comedy in it. But not the kind (umm) you're used to seeing him do. (umm) This is a great DVD. It costs about thirteen dollars anywhere and I would highly recommend it.
