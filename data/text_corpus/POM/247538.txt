Hi, this is my video opinion of xXx: State of the Union.

Hi, my name is Will, and this is my video opinion of (uhh) XXX State of the Union. I thought that you know, this was a okay movie.

I liked the first one better because it was original, and this one (uhh) is pretty much Ice Cube getting leftovers. That's how I viewed it as. You know, it's a lot of scenes with things blowing up, lot of missions accomplished. (uhh) You know, it kind of reminded me of you know, Ice Cube's role in Torque, which I wasn't too thrilled about. (umm) It had a couple cool car scenes. (umm) You see a very fast car in the movie and you know, and it's kinda It's a concept car that I saw at the (uhh)

at the North American (uhh) Car Auto Show but, you know it's, it (stutter) was an okay movie.  You know, it wasn't anything too spectacular. It was pretty much expected. Plot didn't go anywhere. Few, a a (stutter) few minor twists. Nothing too much that wasn't really expected or couldn't be you know, foreseen.

(umm) Overall, it's just okay. You know, if you if you (stutter) like remakes, or you know, sequels to (uhh) you know, okay movies, then you know you might wanna check this one out.
