Hi. Today I'm going to be doing a video review of Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade which is my,

well it's just a really good movie. A lot of people consider it their favorite in the Indiana Jones trilogy but mine is Temple of Doom. Now one good thing about this movie that's different from the other Indiana Jones movies is that this one has Sean Connery in it, the man himself.

He is so cool. He stars as the father

of Indiana Jones

and it's really funny how he follows Indy around just constantly getting on his case and {noise} shaking his junior! {noise} shaking his umbrella around and driving cars and doing all those crazy things that Sean Connery does. Now, as always, in this movie Indiana Jones is fighting the Nazis, this time to regain control

of the (uhh)

the cup of Christ. That's what it is. The first one's the Ark of the Covenant {noise} Holy Grail! That's what it is, thank you. (umm) The Holy Grail,

yes. (umm) And I'm not going to reveal whether or not he actually finds it cause that would ruin the whole point of the movie, but

full of action. This one's actually rated PG-thirteen, and this DVD right here is the widescreen, which I don't do fullscreen movies so it's gotta be widescreen. So that's five out of five. Goodnight, good luck, yeah.
