Hi, I'm here to bring you a video review of yet another Quentin Tarantino film. Now this classic film is Pulp Fiction, starring John Travolta Samuel L. Jackson and it's just an amazing movie. You'll hear just so many pop culture references come from this movie. If you haven't seen it, you will be, watch it and you'll be amazed at all the stuff in pop culture you've been missing. People make references to it all the time.

Now the movie itself is kinda long. It's about a hundred and fifty-four minute. So don't watch it unless you have a nice chunk of time to sit down and really pay attention. 

The movie itself, which also stars Bruce Willis by the way, (umm) has a lot of interweaving, and Ving Rhames can't forget him so cool, has a number of interweaving plot lines. So it's not just one story, it's the story of John Travolta and Samuel L Jackson interacting with Ving Rhames, who also interacts with Bruce Willis. But they're all completely separate stories. So it's just really cool to see them interweave and see them all tie together in the end to show that they're all interconnected. It's kind of like the modern Crash, if you will.

(umm) Now the movie's rated R, and it definitely deserves that R. It's a pretty intense film. So 

(uhh) don't let your kids watch it. But if you're looking for a nice movie to 

(uhh) you know, full of action and violence, hence the name Pulp Fiction,

(umm) check out Pulp Fiction, a film by Quentin Tarantino.
