This is a review of the most recent movie that I've seen, and (umm) it was Harry Potter and I saw it on, well, I saw the midnight premiere, so it was Friday the twenty-third of July. June.

June. And (umm) so this is my ticket. Harry Potter.

It says Friday the twenty-second because I saw the type of thing where you see the first part of (umm) Harry Potter seven, and then right after you see the (stutter) second part. So the first part started at eight forty,

and (umm) I really liked that because it. (umm) Lets you refresh the memory (umm) of what happened in the first part of the movie. But I don't think they're having that any more.

But I really do I really did like the movie. They did a really, really great special effects. (umm) I loved the fight scenes, usually I'm not a huge fight scene fan in movies, but it was really great and had you sitting on the edge of your seat, so I really did like that. (umm) The special effects was great, everything looked so realistic. The acting was great, they really come into their characters. (umm) And I really my favorite part of the movie is at the end, when it has the

(umm) shot into the future of what Harry, Ron and Hermione are going to be like in the future. Really, really loved that part. So I really recommend this movie. Buy it on DVD when it comes out, it's a really great movie.
