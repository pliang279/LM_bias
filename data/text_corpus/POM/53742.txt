Wanted to review this movie Washington Square. (uhh) It stars (uhh) Ben Chaplin and Jennifer Leigh. And it's a story that takes place in the eighteen hundreds in New York. And you have an (uhh),

let's see upper class (umm) doctor

and (uhh) and his homely daughter

and (uhh) (stutter) you have this charming (uhh)

guy that comes along, played by Ben Chapling, Chaplin, who is (umm) 

you don't know if he really loves the homely daughter or if he's out for her money and so that's the plot of the story.

And (umm)

it's really a boring story. I think the story (stutter) I think the movie is like an hour and fifty-five minutes but the whole, the whole time (stutter) you're waiting to, and you're waiting (stutter) and thinking that something's going to happen that's going to make the show interesting and before you know it the show is over with and that exciting thing never did happen. So (umm), you know, I found it boring and I would probably give it, you know, maybe a three out of five rating. 

(uhh) But you can get, you know, you can get Washington Square at Amazon dot com or you can borrow it and rent it. Some people may like it because (umm)

it's in the eighteen-hundreds, maybe mid eighteen-hundreds to late eighteen-hundreds and so (umm) it's interesting watching the social life of that era. That was, that was (stutter) really interesting. And so 

for that reason some some (stutter) people may to want to watch it just to see the, 

you know, the social life of that era. But other than that I really didn't care for it. I thought it was boring and it, the movie is called Washington Square with (uhh) Jennifer Leigh and Ben (stutter) Chaplin.
