Hello, this is It's a Wonderful Life on DVD. 

This is the Frank Capra Christmas classic that everyone sees every Christmas. 

I've had this on tape, two or three times and I finally 

burned all those out from watching it so much and now I have it on 

DVD. This truly is a classic, classic movie and everyone needs to see this. 

Of course the story follows a man who's at the end of his rope and wishes he was never born. 

And an angel (uhh) grants that wish so that they can see 

how George Bailey, that's (uhh) Jimmy Stewart's character, 

(uhh) reacts when he finds out what wouldn't or what would not have happened if he had never been on the earth and it is a classic storyline. This edition has been completely remastered. 

It now has a THX certification for sound, and the 

video itself is very crisp and clear and it's been brightened up and remastered like you have not seen this ever from me, it says it's just like it was when it was originally made. 

I really appreciate the fact that it's very bright and clear because this movie really deserves all 

(uhh) everything they can do to it. It is a timeless classic.

It comes out every Christmas for me and I think it should be part of your Christmas 

movie list, too, it's Frank Capra's It's a Wonderful Life on DVD.
