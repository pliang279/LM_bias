Hi everyone, today I'm gonna go over this DVD called Legend.

It's a very old dvd 

this movie came out 

probably over 

twenty years ago and it has Tom Cruise in it he looks super young, he looks like a baby like probably like eighteen years old, it's one of his first films. 

(umm) It's basically a DVD about 

these characters (stutter) mystical kind of characters like 

elves and princesses and (umm) 

a demon that's trying to take over the world and 

Tom Cruise pretty much comes and saves the day. 

It's a pretty fun movie to watch, especially if you're into that kind of stuff or into those kinds of stories or films. 

It's a old movie but it has really good graphics and really good scenes. 

(umm) There's also a love story behind it, so 

definitely check it out if you're looking for a interesting new different kind of movie to watch. And it's called Legend 

starring Tom Cruise. Thanks.
