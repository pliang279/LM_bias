Hi guys. (umm) Today I'll be talking about the movie Semi-Pro. (umm) This movie is the latest release (umm) in which Will Ferrell is the main leading character. (umm) Supposed to be a comedy movie but it's not much comedy. I enjoyed Will Ferrell's last movie Blades of Glory but this movie's (umm) not up to that mark of comedy. (umm)

In this movie (umm) Will Ferrell is the coach and the star player of the American Basketball Association team. (umm) The name of the team was the Tropics and then (umm) and there was a competition if their team xxx xxx xxx that then their team would be totally (umm) like moshed into some other team. So, he basically had to push all all (stutter) of his players to play a good nice game. But (umm) mean, it it (stutter) was (umm) not that interesting movie. So, (umm) I'm probably gonna give this movie (umm) like two out of five.

(umm) That's it for Semi-Pro.
