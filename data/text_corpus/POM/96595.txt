Hello, I'm Matthew and I'm here to tell you about this (umm) DVD box set. This is the Billy Madison Happy Gilmore collection. It features the two films (umm) both featuring Adam Sandler. (umm) They're both presented on (umm) DVD as you can see here and they fit right in there like that and this opens up and tells you all about (umm) each film on each side. (umm)

They also have (umm) bonus features that each of them by themself (umm) don't have.

And (umm) these two (umm) movies go well together, they kind of fit. (umm) If you like Adam Sandler (umm) I think you will really enjoy this movie, (umm) both of these movies in fact. (umm)

He's really funny in these movies, I remember watching him (umm) when I was really young and we got this box set. It's (umm) pretty cheap. (umm) Only about nineteen dollars for both of them (umm) which is (umm) pretty reasonable but if (umm) somebody is a fan of Adam Sandler I think this would make a good present, maybe a Christmas present or birthday. (umm) Just a great present and I would highly recommend it.
