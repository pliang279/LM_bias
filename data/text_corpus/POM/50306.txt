This is one of my favorite movies ever. You know around Christmas time, there are already a lot of classics out there like The Christmas Story, It's A Wonderful Life, White Christmas and they hadn't made a lot of good Christmas movies in a long time, like ones that would become classics, except this one.

This one was just made and it's definitely

gonna become a classic. It is so funny.

It has Will Ferrell in it and it is so funny, even for adults and for kids. But it's not, it doesn't have anything raunchy and it's not terribly slackening either so everyone. 

I've not found a single person who's watched this movie that doesn't like it.

(umm) Will Ferrell is this elf who thinks he's an elf cause he's adopted into the elf world but he's actually a normal human. 

And he ventures to New York but he's totally sheltered and loves Christmas and everyone's so hardened

and (umm) well kind of predictably brings the spirit of Christmas to them. But it's so funny and

like there's a department store Santa and of course he's not the real Santa and

(umm) Buddy knows the real Santa and he says, you're sitting on a throne of lies, and he gets really upset, it's great.
