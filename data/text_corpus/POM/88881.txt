Today we're gonna take a look at National Lampoon's Loaded Weapon one. 

(uhh) It's a comedy movie.

(uhh) It's sort of a parody of Lethal Weapon.

(uhh) If you've ever seen that, then you'll probably love this one

if you can handle the parody. It does star Emilio Estevez and Samuel L. Jackson.

But I think Samuel L. Jackson is great in this movie as is Emilio Estevez. So if you're a fan of either of them, you'll love this movie. 

(uhh) It has a widescreen and full screen versions on the DVD. So they're both on the same DVD, you don't have to switch sides or anything like that. 

I think this movie's absolutely hilarious but, at the same time

(uhh) you might not enjoy it if you're not a fan of say, The Naked Gun series or anything involving Leslie Nielsen. It's a movie in that style for sure.

(uhh) Once again, that's National Lampoon's Loaded Weapon one and I recommend this movie, I think you should check it out. It does have five point one surround sound and regular surround sound if your system supports that. So, check it out.
