Hello, ExpoTV users. I am here to review a movie that is currently in theaters called Tyler Perry's Meet the Browns. This movie, it has a good heart. It's about family and love and drama and has some (stutter) comedy. It's basically the story about a single mother raising her children, and she really wants to keep her kids off the street, obviously. But she gets fired from her job and begins to get hopeless. And then she finds out that a father, her father that she never even knew existed, had died. So she decides to take her family from Chicago down to Georgia for the funeral. And she meets a whole family she never knew existed.

Basically, it has some touching scenes. It has, does have some funny scenes. But all in all, it seems like he's trying too hard. If you're a Tyler Perry fan, you may enjoy this movie, although I don't even like this one as much as his others and I didn't even like the others too much. It's based on a play of the same name, and, I don't know, I wouldn't really waste my money unless you're a big fan of his. Bye.
