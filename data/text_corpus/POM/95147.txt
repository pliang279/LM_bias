Hi.

Today I'd like to review

reefer madness, on DVD

and this is a

movie that has become become (stutter) kind of a cult classic.

It (umm) 

was made I believe in the thirties,

and it (umm)

basically follows a group of young teenagers who (uhh)

(stutter) start smoking, you know, marijuana or whatever and

of course it leads them to murder and

horrible other crimes but (umm)

it's pretty funny in a way but (umm)

it's not really something I want to see more than once or twice so

(umm) I'm not sure that I would recommend it fully

unless you can find it for pretty cheap. (umm)

DVD doesn't really have that many special features

but (umm) 

still pretty entertaining and (umm)

might make for a few laughs

so

that's my review of Reefer Madness on DVD.
