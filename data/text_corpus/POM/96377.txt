For you Adam Sandler fans out there, you

undoubtedly seen Happy Gilmore. It's about a hockey player who's not a hockey player. In fact he's quite terrible but he's developed one of the hardest slapshots known to mankind. What that translates to I guess in theory is a four hundred yard drive, something that no man has ever done before. I think the great Tiger Woods might tee off at around three-thirty if he's going down with the wind, (uhh) I could be wrong maybe three-fifty. But

it's about it's about it's about (stutter) a hockey reject and actually probably kind of a reject at life who actually ends up going on the PGA tour playing golf with

the pros. Runs into a guy named Shooter McGavin who does this a lot and it's

weird. But anyway he he (stutter) you know ends up teaming with the Apollo from Rocky as (uhh) chubs with no hand. To golfer. And it's it's (stutter) really funny, he does a lot and he's really loud really obnoxious. You would think that golf tournaments are really quiet no, he does like the bullride with his golf club in circles and he cusses a lot and it's really funny hearing all the bleeps. So Happy Gilmore it's really funny, I give it three out of five. (uhh)

Ten years ago I would have given it a five out of five (uhh) so know your audience. Happy Gilmore.
