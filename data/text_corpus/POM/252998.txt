Hi, I'm here to review the movie The House of Yes. Starring Parker Posey, Josh Hamilton, (umm) Tori Spelling, Freddie Prinz Junior. (umm) This was a movie about an eccentric rich family living in Massachussetts who are (umm) obsessed by the Kennedys. (umm) Josh Hamilton plays the son, he's bringing his fiance to meet his family for the first time. (umm)

His his (stutter) mother tries to buy her off (uhh) but it's his sister Parker Posey who is (umm) completely obscene, {laughs} or not obscene, insane and obsessed (umm) by her brother who probably most frightens us (uhh) in this movie. (uhh) The movie is billed as a dark comedy but (uhh)

I didn't really find it all that funny, I found it kind of ridiculous and

(uhh)

maybe bizarre. If if (stutter) that's a good word. (uhh) I think the best line in the movie comes from Tori Spelling when she looks at Parker Posey and says no you're not insane you're just incredibly spoiled. (uhh) The House of Yes a rounding no. A rousing no.
