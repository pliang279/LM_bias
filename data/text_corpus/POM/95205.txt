Hi, today I'd like to review Saved on DVD,

and this is a comedy starring Mandy Moore, Jena Malone, Patrick Fugit and Macauley Culkin.  

And it's basically a, 

teen comedy, satire, about 

people who are overly religious, and,

(umm), well it's got a few funny moments. It's generally pretty predictable and 

not that original. But (umm), the actors are all good (umm),

and it's something that, you know, a young teenager would definitely enjoy.  

(umm), The DVD has a few special features like deleted scenes, bloopers, 

two audio commentaries and a featurette so,

pretty nice for a one disc edition and (umm),

if you're just looking for something kind of light and funny to watch this might be a good choice.

It's called Saved on DVD.
