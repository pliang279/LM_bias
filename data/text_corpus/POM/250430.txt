Hello Expo TV, how you guys doing today? I am here (uhh) to review the new blockbuster movie Vantage Point. (uhh) I think this movie got number one over (uhh) the weekend. Probably because there much else there. Because this movie I I (stutter) wouldn't recommend at all. (umm) It does have some good actors in it though, Forrest Whitaker, Dennis Quaid (umm) etcetera etcetera. There's tons of it, but

(uhh) it it it (stutter) doesn't really go anywhere. (umm) It just keeps, you get tired of it kind of keep repeating itself to see these different vantage points. I thought it'd do that even a little bit different and better but, it didn't even do that. (umm) I can't recommend at all going to this movie. (umm) I I'd (stutter) say wait for TV. (uhh) This just just was a bad movie. (umm) Maybe a couple good spots, but not worth the (uhh) ticket price. (umm) That is Vantage Point. That is all, thank you.
