Hi. My name is Chris.

Hi, my name is Chris, I'm from Atlanta, Georgia. Today I want to talk to you about a DVD. The DVD I want to review is

Beauty and the Beast 

by Disney. (umm) This is the platinum edition, it's a two-disc special feature.

(umm) 

This is a great DVD. Actually, it's one of the greatest, one of the greatest cartoons ever made. It's got a great score, it's got a great story. (umm)

It's a classic. I mean you've got some great comedy, you know, great songs xxx. Of course it's rated G so the whole family can enjoy it. (umm) You actually get two, 

two versions of the film. 

Actually three versions of the film. 

You get some extra music, you get a Celine Dion video, you get never before seen footage, you get 

a video game on there, you get 

all types of good stuff. Commentaries. (umm)

I would definitely recommend this, like I said, it's one of the classics. 

And I would definitely give this one five out of five stars.
