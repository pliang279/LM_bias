Good morning Expo TV. Today I am reviewing The Bourne Supremacy

with Matt Damon as Jason Bourne. This is the second movie in the awesome series. Bourne Identity is the first one. This is when

he's, he was (stutter) peaceful and then they keep searching for him after he escaped them in the first, they keep searching for him. I'm glad to say at the end of this book he really got away and he's

finally 

he's finally done with all of the Treadway stuff. 

Treadway is the project that got him into this. It's an assassin group, and it really ruined his life. 

He was an assassin, but his brain

his mind, just 

overwhelmed

and he was unstable and he forgot everything. 

This is a great movie. It continues with the

continues with the (stutter) shooting and drama. 

On the back, you have scene descriptions and extra stuff that you can get.

(umm) The deleted scenes are kind of funny in this movie. You'd think they would, would be screw up on like actions but they were very funny. I would recommend this movie to for everyone that loved The Bourne Identity and just loves 

Matt Damon in general. Thank you.
