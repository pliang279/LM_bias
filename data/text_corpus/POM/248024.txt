Hi,

I'm Sara and I'm here tonight to tell you about The Shawshank Redemption.

(uhh) This movie came out in the nineteen nineties. It was adapted from a novel by Stephen King. It's starring Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman and the year it came out, it was nominated for seven Academy Awards.

This movie is

one of my absolute favorites. Definitely top three. It is just a terrific movie all around. (uhh) It was nominated, as I said, for seven academy awards, including best picture.

(uhh)And the movie is about Tim Robbins character who ends up going to prison and meeting a whole bunch of lively characters and about his time there. (umm) It's just a terrific movie. It is a drama but there's just

something about it. There's just so much hope in it and it's just very kind of deep movie that makes you think and it's just a terrific movie. So if you have not seen it, see this please see it. Please buy it, you just have to have it for your collection.
