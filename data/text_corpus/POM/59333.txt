I will now be reviewing Aqua Teen Hunger Force 

Colon Movie For Theaters. 

(umm)

Let me first off start by saying that I absolutely hate the 

show Aqua Teen. 

I think it's 

horrible.

I've never been able to watch a full episode, when I do 

I'm just kind of like 

(uhh) 

that's what I'm like. 

So I didn't want to go to see this movie but somebody paid for my movie ticket, so I went. 

And I expected to fall asleep but 

I did not. 

The beginning of the movie starts out with this little dancing, these little dancing (stutter) food people. 

And that part was probably the most hilarious part of the movie. In my opinion. 

So if anything go to see that. 

If you like the show you'll like the movie. 

If you don't like the show, 

you will not like this movie but you won't dislike it as much as you like the show. 

I could have 

about halfway in the movie it's like I, 

I (stutter) think I'd seen enough. 

{noise} I wanted to leave. 

Whoops sorry. I wanted to leave but I couldn't because I was there with a friend and she would not leave 

and she paid for my ticket so how could I really leave. 

(umm) 

I really have no further comment on this movie because I zoned out for most of it. 

So I would just say that (uhh) 

do not 

see it 

{laugh} if you don't like the show. 

That's my, my (stutter) advice for you guys. 

If you like the show see it though. 

And that is all, bye.
