Hey, take it easy.

This is Nacho Libre

starring one Jack Black and a pair of tights. 

(uhh) The story's about Jack Black,

that guy right there.

He works in a 

(uhh) monastery. I'm not sure the technical term but he's he's a (stutter) practically a priest. By night he raises money by fighting as a, a (stutter) luchador.

Which is a 

hispanic wrestler.

Now I'm not a human, Spanish, luchador, wrestling dictionary but I'm, that's pretty sure what I mean, what it means.

(umm) The comedy leaves you wanting a little more. It's kinda weird, it's you wanna laugh but you don't.

There's some good parts. Jack Black has a mustache. 

Personally I gave it one and a half stars out of five. (uhh) It looks nice.

The comedy's in the same vein I'd say, as the director's previous film Napoleon Dynamite but it's just not all there unfortunately. 

Which is kinda sad cause I was really hyped up about this movie. I didn't watch it until I bought it. 

But otherwise, it's worth at least a rental.
