Hey Expo TV. Today I'm here to talk about the movie in theaters Death Race.

(umm) Jason Statham plays the main character in this film. (umm) This is probably one of the worst summer films I've seen so far.

(umm) That will remain on that list since summer's almost over. (umm) Basically the premise for the film is that the American (umm) penal system is becoming over flooded with too many prisoners.

(umm) So what happens basically, the prison system becomes privatized and this company, Waylan Corporation, sees an opportunity to make an extreme sport out of the prison over population.

(umm) So it's completely ridiculous. What happens basically is this extreme sport is the death race. (umm) It's more or less a modernization of Roman gladiators. (umm) The person who wins, the prisoner who wins will get his freedom

and basically everyone else dies trying (umm) is essentially what the game is. Armored cars, machine guns,

basically any way you can get through the race course, (uhh) surviving and taking out (umm) as many as your of your opponents as you possibly can, is how this game works.

(umm) The acting itself I felt was actually quite good. Jason Statham does a fantastic job. (umm)

But, just bad plot really is what killed this movie for me.

Special effects like the car crashes, explosions, gunfire, all that kind of stuff. (umm) That was done quite well I thought, strangely enough. (umm) But like I said the plot is really what pulled this movie down. (umm) Definitely appeals to the young male crowd.

(umm) You have car chases, explosions, gunfights, (umm) and girls all in the same movie. So

(umm) definitely aiming towards the younger crowd there. (umm) I was not impressed though however. I would give this one out of five stars. Not worth your time or your money. Thumbs down.
