This is National Lampoon National Lampoon's (stutter) Pledge This. (umm)

This is a really funny movie (umm) if you like National Lampoon movies. (umm) Paris Hilton does star in this. (umm) And this is about (umm) a sorority which Paris Hilton is a part of (umm) and they are trying to (umm) bring in new mascots. (umm) And so it kind of tells the tale of them bringing in some (umm) mascot or people pledging for the sorority that aren't up to their standards. (umm) And so it's a really funny movie, I'd recommend picking this up. It's not appropriate for younger children. (umm) This is (umm)

rated, probably rated R or not even rated at all. (umm) Yeah unrated version. (umm) But (uhh) it is a funny movie so I'd recommend picking this up. And that's National Lampoon's Pledge This.
