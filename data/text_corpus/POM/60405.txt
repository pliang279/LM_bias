Hi my name's Cort and today I'm going to review the movie Toy Story Two (uhh) which is obviously the sequel to Toy Story. (uhh) it's a

(uhh) Pixar Animation Studios (umm) production and also a (uhh) Walt Disney Pictures production. The running time on this is stated to be ninety-two minutes and it's rated G for general audience. (uhh)

if you've seen the first one, (umm) 

just an amazing, the first one was very good and if you think well they probably couldn't top that or do any better, this one is

as good or better than the first one. A really good movie. Very good (uhh) plot, very (umm) creative. (umm)

again they've got the voice talents of Tom Hanks and Tim Allen are in there. They've also got (umm) 

(uhh) the guy that plays Frasier who I can't think of right off off of (uhh) 

offhand but (umm) in there as well. And (uhh) just a great (uhh) great movie. (umm) 

creativity wise it's just (uhh) an adventure. The kids just love it. My kids have probably seen this twenty times. (umm) Buzz here is their favorite character in the world. And (uhh) just

a neat neat movie. (umm) one that the whole family can watch together and the adults will probably like it if more more (stutter) if not, as much I should say if not more, than the kids do. Just an awesome movie and (umm) 

very, very well done. So I would highly recommend Toy Story Two and Toy Story One for that matter.
