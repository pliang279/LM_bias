I'm doing a review for the movie Ghost Rider starring Nicolas Cage and Eva Mendes. 

(umm) This was probably the worst Marvel movie I have ever seen. (uhh) 

It's even better than Dare (stutter), or even worse than Daredevil I mean. I actually liked Daredevil a little bit, but this was just awful.

(umm) It stars Cage as the Ghost Rider, a supernatural 

(uhh) bounty hunter of the devil, who has to go and chase another bad guy called Black Heart (umm) before he can collect souls and become super powerful.

(uhh) The story was really boring.

(uhh) It didn't go anywhere for a long time.

(uhh) The special effects were pretty good, I'll give them that.

(uhh) Watching (umm) Nicolas Cage transform into the Ghost Rider and back, seeing his flesh peel away, things like that. It was cool to see that.

(uhh) But other than that there weren't many positives in this movie.

(umm) It was just, I was just waiting for this movie to be over it was so boring.

(umm) Eva Mendes can't really act well, but she is extremely easy on the eyes. So if you need an excuse to see that movie (uhh) fellas, that's one. Other than that, I would suggest avoiding it at pretty much all costs.
