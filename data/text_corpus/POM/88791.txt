If you ever wanna make an action movie with (uhh) five dollars for the plot and for (uhh) 

the props and everything. 

This is the movie. 

Phone Booth. 

(umm) Has good names in it, I mean there's Colin Farrell, There's Forest Whitaker and Kiefer Sutherland (umm) good old Jack Bauer's son. 

But, 

the whole story takes place inside of a phone booth. 

You can change the angles all you want but, 

come on. 

This is really boring. 

(umm) Action (stutter) movies usually have action in them. 

So it makes no sense to have it stand in the same spot for 

too long (umm) 

how long is it, two hours. 

I think it's nearly two hours could be wrong on that. 

(umm) Basically it was just terrible. (umm) 

I I (stutter) would never watch this again. 

There's very few movies I would say I'd never watch again and this is one of them. It's up there with Mars Attacks for its annoying factor and the fact that it never moves. 

But I mean there's, there's (stutter) got some twists in it that's every action movie has that. 

(umm) Well any good one. But as far as the action goes it just really wasn't that good, it was more of a drama so 

I don't like that.
