Hey everyone, what's up I'm Pat and I'm reviewing the movie 

Club Dread.

Club Dread

I mean, it was pretty much a huge disappointment.

Still kind of funny

(uhh) but 

if you, if you've (stutter) heard of the movie Super Troopers

(uhh) basically it has the exact same cast as that movie.

(uhh) This movie (uhh) is the same same (stutter) people. It's supposed to be kind of like a Super Troopers two, except having nothing to do with that movie. It's you know the next in line of that comedy team, The Broken Lizard.

But (umm)

I mean it it's it's it's (stutter) an okay movie, it's kinda funny.

(uhh) But I mean, the thing is to compare it to Super Troopers, which you're supposed to

it's it's (stutter) there's no comparison. Super Troopers is just much better.

(uhh) This movie just

it was kind of kind of a disappointment. 

I don't even know really why I, I (stutter) bought it because I hadn't seen it in theaters and I knew who was in it so I was like, it's gotta be good.

Meh

(uhh) I'd stick to Super Troopers if I were you. If you have that movie in your library, watch that and then just assume that this movie's okay. No real need to see it, I wouldn't really recommend it too much.
