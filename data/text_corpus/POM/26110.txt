Okay right here I have one of my favorite movies. This is

Amelie. This is a two thousand one French film. It's a romance comedy.

(umm) This actually won best film at the European Movie Awards. It's about a girl named Amelie. She's 

(umm) a sweet girl, naive, shy and this is basically her trying to figure out her life. Going through some changes. 

(umm) She basically has a dysfunctional family and she's trying to make everyone around her happy

(umm) but then she falls in love. So it's basically about her changing into a woman and becoming happy herself. I definitely recommend this movie. 

(umm) Like I said it's a romance comedy. So

a great love story but it's also pretty funny at times.

(umm) 

It's a French film like I said, so it has subtitles. If you don't mind that, then I definitely think that Amelie is something that almost anybody could enjoy.

Definitely a great movie. It's called Amelie and I think you should go watch it today.
