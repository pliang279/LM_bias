I am doing a review of the movie Hot Fuzz, which is out in theaters now.

Hot Fuzz was the most refreshing and delightful movie I have seen in quite some time. 

It had me chuckling from start to finish. {laughs}

In fact the whole theater, when I was there, was laughing (stutter) almost the entire time.

(umm) So if you're a fan of Shawn of the Dead, you will love this movie.

And the original British Office or (uhh) the British comedy Extras, you will too love this movie.

(uhh) The movie started off kind of slow, the long introduction that I could of have been half as long. But once the movie got going, it was excellent and fast paced and funny. Parodies of American cop movies popped up throughout the film. 

The main character, Sergeant Nicholas Angel, played by Shaun of the Dead's Simon Pegg, 

he outshines all of the

London's police academy. Because of this, they transfer him to the small town of Sanford. Hilarity ensues.

See the movie, you won't regret it. You will not regret it. It's very good. When I went there, the entire theater was laughing. It's really delightful, 

funny movie unlike all the other movies you've seen.

(uhh) I also enjoyed how in the cop scenes or in the

scenes where they're fighting, no one actually gets killed. They just get like

hurt a little bit and all captured and put in prison. So that was a nice refreshing change. So see the movie.
