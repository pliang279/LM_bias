Curtis here with the new (uhh) the new Hannibal movie, Hannibal Rising. 

Now this is a blockbuster exclusive I guess. 

Apparently a straight to DVD rental. 

(uhh) So {cough} 

you can find it at any Blockbuster. 

(uhh) I was expecting something a little more gory, maybe a little more horror-ish. 

But it was really really like (stutter) timid and (uhh) 

pretty, pretty (uhh) 

pretty low, 

I don't know low budget but not really I don't know. Hannibal (uhh) 

Hannibal Lecter wasn't really, he was played as a character that was like a teenager and he, 

he (stutter) was kind of like progressing into his cannibalistic stage of the other movies. 

(uhh) I wouldn't really recommended it if, recommend it (stutter) if you wanna 

like watch a Hannibal movie I'd recommend just going to see like Silence of the Lambs or (uhh) 

Hannibal, the other Hannibal movies. 

Which are okay, they're not, they're not (stutter) that great either. 

But (uhh)  

I don't know I'd recommend it if you want. 

(stutter) If you wanna see a movie that takes before Hannibal I recommend it but if you 

like the Hannibal movies and you don't wanna ruin it, 

don't see this movie 

cuz it will probably ruin it and (uhh) 

you probably won't like Hannibal anymore 

cuz he's 

I don't know. 

Really, really weakling in this movie, 

okay, alright, that's my review. Thanks.
