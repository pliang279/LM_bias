This is a movie. It's a DVD, it's called The Secret of Nikola Tesla, T-E-S-L-A, and 

(uhh) if you don't know who Nikola Tesla is, he's the guy back in the turn of the century he worked with George Westinghouse and 

(uhh) some other famous guys in developing the 

(uhh) actually Tesla came up with the idea for the AC motor

and the AC generators and motors, some electrical stuff. And

(umm) this movie is kind of a story about his life and I'll just read some of this.

This (stutters) his achievements, Nikola Tesla, lead to the discovery of the radio and television as well as the development of the first hydroelectric dam, remote control, radar tracking for the military, x-rays 

and manipulation of matter and energy. So this guy was really smart guy back then and (uhh)

and he made a large contribution towards, you know, the electronic age we have today.

And (uhh) I was seeing

documentaries on Nikola Tesla's life and I much rather see the documentaries than this movie. This movie 

(uhh) you know, is in the movie format. So it kinda you know, it's like his life from a child you know, to when he's grown up til he's

dealing with all these electronic things and other powerful men like J.P. Morgan.

And (umm) this movie I would rate like you know, a two out of five. It's not a good movie because the

just the movie was bad. The you know there were some parts in there where, you know, he's talking to his friend in some foreign language and there's no subtitles so it goes on for two or three minutes you don't even know what he's saying.

And the picture quality was really bad and just the story. If I didn't know you know the the (stutter) background of Nikola Tesla I would not

(umm) I couldn't follow the movie too good. So again, I do not recommend this movie

(uhh) at all.

(umm) So

don't buy it.
