Hey how you doing. I'm gonna tell you a little bit about this movie called The Karate Kid II. 

(umm) This is the same characters that was in Karate Kid I which is great because it's always good to have a sequel that has the same characters so that things just keep carrying and basically the ploy behind this one is 

(umm) obviously (umm) Pat Morita has taught Daniel here how to do karate and they've won some contests, all that happened in Karate Kid one. 

Well in Karate Kid II,

(umm) Miyagi now takes Daniel over to Japan, over to Okinawa and from there they kind of get mixed up into a old life, you know, life long family feud. and it's the just the drama brings out from there.

(umm) But you know, I mean it's it's (stutter) okay for a sequel. 

(umm) It's not that great but it's it's (stutter) okay. I wouldn't wouldn't (stutter) really run out and get it. But if you're able to get you know, all three of em. But you gotta see the first one before you see the second one, okay. This is one of those times that you need to see em in order, because it makes a lot better sense. But 

(umm) it is rated PG because it does deal with fighting and there is fighting, there's karate and those things do happen.

(umm) So take, but take a look at it. It's called Karate Kid II and it stars Pat Morita and like I said it's a pretty good movie.

(umm) You know, you know (stutter) it's still a family type movie and it'd be good for the family to see it.

(umm) You know 

just kind of you know, I'm not really completely sold on it. It's not as good as the (stutter) as good as the first one, but it does carry on with the story, okay. 

It actually even says it, the story continues. It just kind of carries on where the story left off, okay. But take a look at The Karate Kid II. Thanks.
