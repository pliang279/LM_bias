Keanu Reeves has risen to be one of the (uhh) most popular 

(uhh) action stars of pretty much in the last, probably a decade. 

(uhh) He however did get started making (uhh) oh, 

rather bad films. 

Point Break is one of his worst. 

{hmm}, Point Break he plays this, a young FBI agent that (uhh) 

pretty much goes on 

(uhh) or starts with a company and has a partner, Gary Busey, who is a little bit more (uhh) 

experienced. He gives undercover and becomes a surfer and someone who's generally addicted to extreme sports. 

He meets up with (uhh) 

Patrick Swayze, which 

(stutter) the is known as the world's most shirtless man. 

(umm) 

They (uhh) work together 

yeah, to uncover, Busey and Keanu Reeves work together to uncover (uhh) 

a string of bank robberies that are portrayed (uhh) (stutter)

that are done by the (uhh) surfer gang that Keanu Reeves joins. 

(umm) There's also skydiving, (umm) 

bad acting, and in general just mayhem. 

The movie is meant to be taken seriously, but it's good for a laugh, nothing else.
