I'm reviewing the DVD White Christmas. It's a musical written by Irvin Berlin.

(umm) This one has 

(uhh) Bing Crosby and Danny K in it. 

As (uhh) 

soldiers in World War II Who leave the service and

(uhh) Bing Crosby's already an entertainer and 

(uhh) due to a personal favor he (uhh) he owes (stutter) to Danny K, they become 

(uhh) partners and they become really popular. 

They decide to 

(uhh) go to their old generals

(uhh) bed and breakfast in Vermont to help his business by (uhh) doing a show there for him.

(uhh) This is probably my favorite Christmas movie. 

(uhh) It is in black and white but, who cares.

(umm) There's (uhh) 

not really any kind of special features on here. But that's not really a big deal cause it's such an old movie. 

(umm) This movie (uhh)

a little over two hours long. But

(uhh) if you have seen it you should definitely check it out.
