Hi. I'm reviewing the (uhh)

DVD release of Basic. It stars (uhh) John Travolta and Samuel Jackson. It's (uhh) a military movie. (umm)

John Travolta is sent to, to (stutter) investigate the disappearance of Samuel Jackson who's (uhh) a disliked drill sergeant. (umm) They think he's too tough on the recruits and they think that he may have gotten some of them killed. (umm) I did not care for this movie at all. (uhh)

The twists and the turns weren't really 

inspired or creative or (stutter) even interesting. It just seemed like they came up with random things to happen that (uhh)

I don't know. It just, by the time you get to the end of the movie it felt like a waste of time to have watched any of it. (uhh) The ending was pretty silly, in my opinion and (uhh) 

overall I would have to say this was a pretty poor movie, and the DVD is also pretty poor with (uhh) nothing more than a couple small featurettes for special features.
