Hi expotv, today I'm going to review for you the movie Paper Heart. (uhh) This movie is rated PG-thirteen, it just came out this past Friday, it's in selected theaters. (umm)

It's a really good movie, I loved this movie. (umm) It stars Charlyne Yi who had like a bit part in Knocked Up and Michael Cera who's been in a lot of movies like Superbad and Juno, he was in Arrested Development the TV show. (umm) And then there's some other people in there but they're pretty much the main characters. (uhh) It's basically Charlyne and one of her friends is doing sort of a fake documentary. (umm)

There's parts of it that are a a real documentary that they were doing, it's about love and it's the, the (stutter) basic story is that she's somebody who doesn't believe in love and, and (stutter) doesn't think she'll ever fall in love, so she sets out to see if they can make her believe in love or, you know, anything like that. And so they her and her friend go around interviewing people around the country and those parts are real. (umm) People tell their stories about how they fell in love or what they think about love and (umm) it's really good but then a (stutter) over the course of them filming this comes in the story, and it's how she meets (umm) Michael Cera and they sort of, sort of fall in love, they start dating, (umm) and then it follows them around. I won't give away the ending (umm) but that's what the movie's about. It's really funny, it was really funny and really cute. I loved it. (umm) It's rated PG-thirteen, there's some cursing in it but it's not anything major. (umm) There's really nothing in it I think that's bad for for (stutter) young teenagers to see at all. (umm) It was a really good movie, like I said it's very cute. (umm) And I would recommend this movie to anybody, it's out in theaters now. It is called Paper Heart.
