Hello everybody out there in expo TV land This Matthew and (uhh) today I am reviewing the (uhh) Zombieland movie (umm) I heard great things about this movie it stars Woody Woody (stutter) Harrelson and some other people I am not quite sure who they are a really but funny movie so (uhh)

throughout the movie kept me engaged kept me kept me (stutter) interested in the characters the characters really good (umm) really funny if you like Shawn of the Dead. You'll love this movie too, just as funny. (umm) and don't want to give away too much but near the three quarters the way through the movie there is a great cameo which everybody enjoys (umm)

and (uhh) it's just a really fun movie it had some great visual, some great special effects with (uhh) the main characters rules how to survive Zombieland and so if you like Shawn of the Dead, if you like zombie movies if you like comedies I definitely recommend this. I give it five out of five.

Five out of five, so go see Zombieland. Either rent it or go it. Rent it comes out or go see it in theaters wile it's still there. And enjoy the movie.
