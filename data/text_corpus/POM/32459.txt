Hi, 

(umm) I'm reviewing  right now

(uhh) the movie Donnie Darko.

(umm) This is a really goo sci-fi time travel movie. It's very cool, it's definitely 

(umm) like, a a (stutter) cult classic kind of thing I guess.

(uhh) It's, Jake Gyllenhaal is in here, which 

(umm) I don't know if this is one of his first movies or anything like that, but he does a great job in here.

(umm) and 

(uhh) the the (stutter) movie itself is just really freaky and (stutter) it's really cool. I guess like a self sacrificing kind of moral to the story.  

(umm) And 

(uhh) a lot of the things that happen here are just like, just really like

I don't know, it's it's (stutter) a very dark and scary movie as well, which is really cool.

(umm) I definitely think you could pick this up at Amazon dot com or like Borders's or anywhere like that they sell DVD's for pretty cheap because it's it's (stutter) not a new movie by any means.

(umm) But if you haven't seen Donnie Darko

(uhh) I definitely recommend going and 

(uhh) like rent it or buy it somewhere if you can. 

(uhh) It's definitely a good movie to see.
