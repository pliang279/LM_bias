Hi. Today I'm reviewing Hellboy Two. It's currently playing in theaters right now. (uhh) I went to go see this movie (umm) and

it was a big disappointment. From the trailers it looked (uhh) really action packed and exciting and (umm) kind of like a fairy tale with a darker side. But (uhh)

when I saw it I was just unimpressed. (umm) The little side jokes weren't funny at all, and the acting was just kind of

so bland and just the overall presentation and performance of everything about this movie it just wasn't satisfactory for me. And

I just expected so much more from it. So I didn't enjoy it a whole lot at all. (umm) If I had to give it a rating I'd say it's a two out of five for me. (umm)

It just (uhh)

I didn't enjoy it. It had so much potential and it could have been a whole lot better but it was just

pretty poorly done. And so I wouldn't recommend to see it, but (umm) I guess the target audience would be people in my age group. (umm)

Young people in their twenties, thirties, or young children like teenagers, or even little (uhh) ten-year-olds they may enjoy this cause it's (uhh) I mean they may find the jokes funny but I didn't. It was just (uhh) not adult humor I guess. And (uhh)

so, yeah. Didn't like it. That's it. Hellboy Two.
