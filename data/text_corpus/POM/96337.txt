What if you were to take your face and put it on somebody else's face 

and take their face and put it on yours. 

What you would have is a face off. 

This movie stars John Travolta and Nicolas Cage. 

I am a big Nicolas Cage fan I think he's really cool 

but Nicolas Cage is this really really bad bad guy. 

He ends up killing John Travolta's son in the very beginning and John Travolta swears revenge. 

He ends up getting really close in capturing him, in fact he captures him 

but the problem is 

before he captured him, he planted a bomb where no one else knows where it is so, 

you gotta stop the bomb but here's the deal, 

Nicolas Cage is knocked out cold  

so what they do is they take John Travolta's face and they peel it off. 

Then they take John Travolta's face and they peel it off 

and they put it on John Travolta's face. 

John Travolta then goes into a maximum security prison in order to get the information from Nicolas Cage's brother.

I know what you are thinking, 

five out of five. I know the plot sounds wonderful. 

You need to see it. This movie rocks. 

But seriously, it's a B movie but it's still five out of five so it's going to be a little cheesy.
