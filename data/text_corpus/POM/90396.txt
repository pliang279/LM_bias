Hi, this is a review of the movie three hundred.

(umm) For those who don't know it's 

(uhh) loosely based on a historical Greek battle and the movie

is takes place about

(uhh) three hundred years B.C. but it also has a lot of mythology mixed in so it's not historically accurate at all and the violence is extremely over exaggerated and it's very, it's highly stylized I guess you could say. 

(umm) A lot of people are confused and think it's directed by the same person as Sin City.

(uhh) That's not the case.

It was based on a comic by the same guy who wrote the comic book Sin City. But (uhh) the violence is stylized just like the violence in Sin City just not the black and white type style.

About eighty percent of the movie seems to be in slow motion, like someone getting a body part cut off or just 

(uhh) blood flying through the air and the dialogue is cheesy and cliche. But the violence and the scenery more than makes up for it and

(uhh) if you haven't already seen it, I would go see it now while it's still in theaters so you get the full experience of seeing it on the big screen. Or get it on like HD DVD when it comes out for sure cause it's got some

some of the best special effects and cinematography I've seen in a recent movie. It's action packed, I definitely wouldn't take the kids to see it. 

(uhh) Cause there is some nudity and tons of violence but all in all it's a pretty good film, especially if you're a guy.
