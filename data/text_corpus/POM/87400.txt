Hi, I'm back

and I'm going to be giving a review of a movie I did not like,

Ocean's Twelve. 

Now

I loved Ocean's Eleven, it was just a great movie and it had all these great actors in it and it was just a lot of fun,

but Ocean's Twelve seems like it was really stretching to you know, find a plot to find some action, just all around to find some entertainment. I just wouldn't recommend it. I mean it's got George Clooney, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Matt all those people.

(umm) But none of em were just very good in this movie. I mean, they they're (stutter) good actors, it's just a boring movie. 

Now the plot of this movie

is that they

(umm) are actually I

believe in Europe. Yeah they're in, it's been awhile since I've seen it, they are in Europe and looking to find a safe and it just, you know I honestly don't even remember that much but I was just falling asleep during the movie, it just wasn't good. 

Now

they seem to have 

(uhh) redeemed themselves in Ocean's Thirteen, which is actually out in theaters right now. I just saw that and that's a fantastic movie. So don't write off the entire series just because this one movie is bad. But

it is. 

If you haven't seen Ocean's Eleven, go see it. It's amazing.

Skip Ocean's Twelve, go see Ocean's Thirteen. 

So, I would give this movie, a two out of five. It was just 

it was just weak and it was not something that I really liked that much.

Yeah

alright, well, have a good night.

Goodbye.
