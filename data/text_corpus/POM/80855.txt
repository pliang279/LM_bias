Alright. 

Pretty, pretty good. Season four Curb Your Enthusiasm. The acclaimed series. Larry David returns for a fourth season. He had five in total, so far. Hopefully he comes back for six. That's my fingers being crossed. (uhh) Ten episodes this whole, actually eleven because the tenth episode is pretty much two episodes of it together and it's like an hour. (uhh) This whole season is about him

{clears throat}

joining the (uhh) cast of (uhh) The Producers,

featuring Mel Brooks. He's (uhh) in the, 

he's in a couple episodes. Ben Stiller, and Ben Stiller's boy are in some episodes. David Schwimmer and some guy playing David Schwimmer's dad is in this too. (umm) 

After four seasons, actually I have all five seasons, they're phenomenal. It's good stuff. As you see, it keeps to the same packaging which is amazing (uhh)

you know. 

Let me open this again cause this is, 

this always amazes me. I like to just sit around, when I can get it to okay, maybe this one doesn't work, but that's not the point. The point is this this (stutter)  season is as good as all five seasons. it gets a five out of five stars. Larry David's a (uhh)

curmudgeon and a genius. There you go.
