I am reviewing Elf, (uhh) which is a cute cute Christmas (stutter) movie. (uhh) It is rated PG. It stars Will Ferrell and it actually has (umm) lots of other people in it that are famous for other things. Ed Asner and Bob Newhart, Mary Steenburgen and (uhh) anyways. Basically the premise, as you can see over my shoulder , there's this baby and in an orphanage and Santa comes to visit the orphanage and the baby accidentally goes back with Santa to the North Pole and so he is raised as if he is an elf although he's a full grown man. So at the beginning, you see him with all these elves and he's just not quite fitting in. So he finally realizes or finds out that he is actually a human and not an elf so he goes to Manhattan to find his real dad and (umm) his family and he realizes that (stutter) his dad and the rest of the world don't have quite the Christmas spirit that he thinks they should have. So

he with the help of a department store elf that he falls in love with, try to teach the world the true meaning of Christmas and help Santa in the end. So it's a very cute family Christmas movie.
