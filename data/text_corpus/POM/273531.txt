Hey Expo TV. Today I'm here to talk about the movie in theaters, Mirrors (uhh) featuring Kiefer Sutherland. After seeing this one (umm) recently here, I pretty much got what I expected from it. (umm) And what I expected was a poor cliche (umm)

horror film with bad acting, bad plot

(umm) trying to, you know just trying to scare you and failing miserably. That's exactly what this movie was. (uhh) The premise for this movie is

Kiefer Sutherland's character

(umm) takes up a job as a night watchmen in a burnt out department store.

And there's mirrors in this department store.

And (uhh) in the mirrors, naturally he sees horrific images. (umm) You know, demonic images. He see's himself (uhh) like being tortured and stuff like that. (umm) And I don't wanna ruin the pathetic plot of this movie

(umm) but obviously he has to confront what's behind these visions in the mirrors and discover why it's happening, how it's happening, how to stop it, why it's happening to him. Actually he needs to enlist some help from his friend Amy.

(umm) And it's just kind of your classic

(umm) bad horror film. It wasn't really scary, very very predictable

(umm) and poor acting. Kiefer Sutherland (umm) does a very bad job in this film with his acting. He's not convincing. The fear he's supposed to be conveying to the audience doesn't seem real. It seems very forced. (umm) It seems like he's expecting what he's seeing (umm) which obviously as the actor he is, but as the character he supposed to be, he's not supposed to expect it so it doesn't really fit. (umm) Combine that with bad language also in the film and this movie just goes downhill. So I'm gonna say one out five stars for The Mirrors. (umm) Don't waste your time with this horror flick (umm) much better ones out there. Thumbs down.
