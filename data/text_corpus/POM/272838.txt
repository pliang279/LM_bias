Hello Expo TV. (umm) Today I'm reviewing the movie

Death Race. (uhh)

This means two out of five. (uhh) It really wasn't very good. (uhh) It stars Jason Statham.

You might recognize him from the Crank movies, where he was like a getaway driver kind of,

drug runner.

Anyways,

(umm) where do I start? (umm) The movie takes place in two thousand twelve. It's about a guy that goes to prison for a crime he didn't commit. It's a like, for profit prison where they have this pay-per-view creation that's these death races and

they have convicts racing in like cars with all kinds of crazy stuff like missiles and flamethrowers and machine guns and

they kill each other and if you win,

it's five races, you get your freedom. So, that's kind of the premise of the movie. (umm)

Honestly that sounds pretty stupid. I don't even know why I saw it. (uhh) But at least now you guys are warned. Don't see Death Race. (uhh) I wouldn't even rent it.

It's really pretty bad. (uhh) I mean, there's a lot of action. If you like senseless action, Death Race is your movie. But otherwise, Death Race, two out of five.
