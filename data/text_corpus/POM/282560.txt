Hello. I wanna tell you about a movie I just saw in theaters. It's called Punisher: War Zone. This is of course a movie based upon the popular Marvel character The Punisher. Punisher AKA Frank Castle is played by Ray Stevenson and he's up against his classic nemesis, Jigsaw, played by Dominic West. This is actually

not that great of a movie. I was kind of disappointed. Most of the Marvel movies have been pretty good in recent years and most of the comic book movies in general have been fairly well done. This one's kind of weak, this is the third time they've made a Punisher movie and second one in recent years. It seems it's always getting a new cast and a new direction and it's just not working for me. The Punisher himself is kind of an avenging (uhh) angel, kind of in the grey area. Is he a good guy or bad guy? He goes out and punches those who have done wrong, basically by hunting them down and killing them. And (uhh) just like in the comic books (uhh) when he's good he's really good. When he's

(uhh) bad it's unreadable. Well (uhh) when he's bad in the movies he's unwatchable. It's just a little too silly. It's a very very violent movie but the violence is

kind of poorly done. I mean, violence in and of itself is (uhh) okay, I reckon, if it's done correctly. But this kind of weak (uhh) I mean it's over the top violence. It's more ridiculous than it is (uhh) gritty and (uhh) I just didn't think they were able to pull this movie together. So I'll have to give it two stars, which is sad because I really like the character.
