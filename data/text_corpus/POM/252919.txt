Hello expotv, today I'd like to warn you about Trick or Treat. This movie is a terrible waste of your time on many levels.

First off we see Ozzy Osbourne and Gene Simmons on the cover pretty big. Their names nice bold and white.

These men each have less than a minute of screen time and very few lines. (uhh)

This movie is just stupid and terrible. It's about a record that is the last recording of some rock star who dies and some kid gets his hands on it and through some

circus of events, I don't know, the rock star comes back to life as an evil ghost rock star. And he starts trying to kill people and he tries to set a high school on fire or something. (uhh) It doesn't have a good story at all and the acting's terrible, and you know a movie sucks when the best they can do is try and pull the two big names out of it and put them on the front cover to trick you. (uhh) Even the back sucks. They have pictures of people working on completing special effects. These guys are painting a monster used in the movie. They didn't even have his hands. So you can't come up with a really cool scene from a movie to put on the back of the box? You have to use special effects guys giggling as they paint a monster? Stay away. There is (uhh) supposedly a remake of this coming out and

I would be just as wary of it as I am of this (uhh) version

because it's just it's just (stutter) horrible. It's terrible and

I {sigh} I would just, if anybody says "hey we should watch Trick or Treat" you should probably not be friends with them anymore. I kind of just keep this copy around so if people are around and they be like "oh, hey what's -" no, if you ever see that you should run the other way because it is just the worst idea ever.
