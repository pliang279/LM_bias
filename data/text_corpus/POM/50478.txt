This is a video review for the

DVD movie Crimson Tide. 

The, 

this version is widescreen and the rating on it is rated R,

it's got a lot of bad language in it. 

The genre is like an action thriller

and the length of the movie

is, where does it say, a hundred and sixteen minutes. 

This movie, what this movie is about is it's got Denzel Washington and Gene Hackman, two of my favorite actors in this movie. It's about (uhh) a old 

guy that's in the, 

in the (stutter) (uhh) army which is Gene Hackman, or in the navy, and a new guy coming in Denzel Washington they're, 

they're (stutter) both on the submarine and they both have conflicting orders that come through and they can't read them, so they both take a stand on what they think they say, and there's a big argument. Lot of drama in it, and

it's leading up to world war, possible world war three in it and

it's a really good, 

it's a really good (stutter) drama movie. Action drama. So anyway I highly recommend this movie. I won't say too much about it cause I don't want to give it away. Anyway, that's my video review for Crimson Tide.
