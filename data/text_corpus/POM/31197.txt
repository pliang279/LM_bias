I'm going to be reviewing the movie Hamburger Hill.

This movie's about a (uhh) 

unit of American soldiers during the Vietnam war who have to defend 

this 

actually, no they have to attack this hill and (uhh) 

try to 

remove the (uhh) 

North Vietnamese from there. 

It's (uhh) 

it's a pretty sad movie, since (uhh) 

some 

people who you weren't expecting to die do in fact die. 

The (uhh) 

only thing about this movie is there's (uhh) 

some better 

Vietnam movies out there and 

with better casts. 

This 

cast is (uhh) 

the most notable person on here is probably 

Don Cheadle or that guy from practice, I don't remember his name. 

So 

I give this movie (uhh) 

two out of five.
