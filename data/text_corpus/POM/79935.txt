Hi, I'm gonna review a movie in theaters now and this movie's called Knocked Up and it stars Katherine Heigl and some other (uhh) cast members and I was really disappointed with the with the (stutter) movie and felt you know, I got short changed. I wanted to go back to the manager and ask for my money back

(uhh) cause this movie is really bad. Now it is rated R for sexual content and language and drugs and it had all three of those and

the drugs it had too much and just totally unnecessary.

(uhh) 

(uhh) shots about drugs or scenes with drugs in it 

and the language in it was horrible. It was bad. (uhh) Really gross language.

So you definitely don't wanna take your children to this movie.

In fact I wouldn't wouldn't (stutter) recommend the movie to anybody unless you're over a hundred. (uhh) Even then

(uhh) It's probably not a good movie to watch.

But I was totally 

(uhh) totally (uhh) turned off by the movie and

you notice that, or we notice that in the trailers that they put out on the movie, you know they only showed the funny shots. Had they put out the bad language shot, I don't think as many people would go to see the movie. 

But (stutters) Katherine was the only 

(umm) actress in there that did a credible job of acting. All of the other actors were terrible. 

(uhh) They just weren't good actors. The script was bad and it's just totally a gross movie. I wouldn't recommend it.

(uhh) 

(uhh) Wouldn't recommend this movie to anybody.

In fact (uhh) I would give it an award. It was, this is the worse movie in ten years award is what I would give the movie.

(uhh) So again, the movie is Knocked Up. Don't go see it, it's bad.
