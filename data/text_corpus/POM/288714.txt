I went to the movies (uhh) with the people that I work with, and we saw the movie The Unborn.

I kind of wondered about this movie when I saw the previews. It was one of those ones that was gonna go one way or the other. It was either gonna be really good or it was gonna be really bad. Unfortunately, it was really bad. It was one of the worst movies ever.

The story line was completely stupid. It it (stutter) wasn't a good horror movie. It wasn't spooky. It wasn't scary. There was no part of the movie that made you jump. There were no you know, got you minutes or anything like that. I mean it was just

dumb.

(umm) I didn't like the movie. I wouldn't recommend it. If I saw it on TV I would change the channel. (umm) I would, I would (stutter) tell everybody not to waste their money going to see it. If you're a die hard horror picture movie person, you probably still won't like it. But if you still want to see it, wait for it to come on DVD. Don't waste your money in the theater. The Unborn was a complete disappointment.
