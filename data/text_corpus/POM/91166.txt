Today I'm reviewing The Good Shepherd on High Definition DVD and regular DVD.

(umm) This is a special edition kind of thing where you get it in HD format, then on the other side it's in regular DVD so you don't always need an HD DVD player to play it. You can go take it over to your friend's house. But anyway, The Good Shepherd, it 

(umm) it's a really great movie. The story line, it's a it's (stutter) about the (umm) the creation of the central intelligence agency, (uhh) back in the sixties, and they talked about the Bay of Pigs invasion and how the CIA started. So if you're really into, you know spy movies or spy novels or things like you know, the military industrial complex, or government or politics, political issues, it's really, you'll really love this movie. But if you're, even if you're you know, a girl or something or you like all the, you know family stuff and you know, the boyfriend girlfriend troubled marriage stuff, there's a lot of this in here too because the people who work for the CIA, at least in this movie, are (umm)

pretty intense and pretty dedicated to their work which obviously caused problems back at home. So it's it's (stutter) really for everybody. It's a great movie. It's one of those things that everybody should see. So, go get it.
