Hello, I am Matthew and I'm here to tell you about this DVD movie, Little Black Book.

(umm) This is

a romantic comedy.

But I really didn't enjoy it that much I have to say.

(umm) It wasn't very romantic.

(umm) The jokes weren't really that funny. It just didn't work.

(umm) The chemistry (stutter) between these two people, 

(umm) it just doesn't work.

(umm) It was slightly choppy at times.

(umm) This is definitely a chick flick, I think

(umm) many teenage girls would probably enjoy it and you know, I don't really mind (umm)  romantic comedies (umm) if they're good

but this one just didn't work.

(umm) It drug out.

(umm) I couldn't wait for this movie to be over.

(umm) The only thing redeeming about this

(uhh) movie, was about a thirty second cameo by 

(umm) Gavin Rossdale, which is a rock singer.

(umm) That was the only thing I liked about this movie. (umm) This is not a good movie to watch with your girlfriend.

(umm) I didn't enjoy it. I think thirteen dollars is too much for this movie and I would not recommend it.
