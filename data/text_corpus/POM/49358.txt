Hey, what's up? Okay, today I'm going to be reviewing a movie. 

This is Nicolas Cage. He's in this movie called Gone in Sixty Seconds. Gone in Sixty Seconds is a remake of a seventies film by the same name 

and basically it's about

a car a car (stutter) thief gang that has to steal a certain number of cars within a short period of time, and (uhh) this movie involves a lot of car chases obviously, and it involves a lot of fast cars, a lot of fancy cars. You'll see lots of Ferraris and Lamborghinis. If you like (uhh)

if you like that kind of thing then this, this movie could be for you. I was actually disappointed, I was hoping for a lot more, I don't know why. I've been disappointed by Nicolas Cage many times.

(uhh) Also this is a Jerry Bruckheimer film and (umm)

I don't really like Jerry Bruckheimer. I don't think he (uhh)

I don't think he really cares about making good movies, he cares about making movies that make money. So it's lots of explosions, lots of action, but not necessarily a lot of interesting action. It doesn't always seem motivated 

plot wise. (uhh)

Ultimately

if you haven't seen it, if you haven't seen Gone in Sixty Seconds go rent this original seventies version, you'll probably get more entertainment out of that. I give (uhh) the modern Gone in Sixty Seconds

two out of five. 

Sorry Nic.
