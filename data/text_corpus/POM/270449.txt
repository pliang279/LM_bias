This is Blood: The Last Vampire. It's a anime.

It's considered like a masterpiece. A lot of people highly recommend this. I watched it, I didn't think it was that great.

They even made a series after it, based off of the movie. The story, by the time it got started, it was already over.

It didn't actually start taking root til the very end of the like the last thirty minutes of the movie and by that time it was already over.

The animation, the graphics of it, it was it looked really good in some parts, and it some parts it looked horrible. But a lot of people praised it for its graphics at the time. I, I (stutter) didn't see it so much. (uhh) I'd say it was the average anime. I really wouldn't say that I would see it again if I had a choice.
