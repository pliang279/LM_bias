Hey guys, (uhh) I'm going to do a quick review on the movie called Epic Movie. 

It's basically a movie (uhh) comedy satire 

(uhh) it's it (stutter) mocks movies such as the (uhh) Da Vinci Code, Nacho Libre, X-Men, 

(umm) Land of Narnia, 

(uhh) Chocolate Factory, 

and some other movies I can't really think of right now. 

(uhh) it it's (stutter) a movie that you don't really don't need brains to go watch it. 

It's a lot of toilet humor and cheap laughs, 

and if you are really really really desperate for that kind of a comedy, I 

highly recommend this movie for you. (umm) 

I mean if you are expecting (uhh)

a lot more, I mean with this type of movie I 

don't think you will enjoy it. 

(uhh) It's, 

it's (stutter) got a pretty, pretty (uhh) low rating (umm) right now, but it's doing very well surprisingly, in the box office. 

So if you're really desperate for (uhh) 

I mean, cheap laughs and that sort of (uhh) 

genre movie I would highly recommend (uhh) 

this movie to you. 

If you're not in, not into this type of movie, avoid it if you can.
