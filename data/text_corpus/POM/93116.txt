Hey. (uhh) This is a review for The Invisible which (umm)

{sigh} is currently in theaters, at least not to DVD yet. (umm) It is, it's it's (stutter) terrible. It's (umm)

a complete

(uhh) waste of time to watch. The story was (umm) 

the (stutter) the outline or the (uhh) general theme of the movie was a pretty good one but (uhh) didn't really execute it very well. (umm)

{sigh} had some pretty annoying 

scenes like where they

show him doing something and then it'd reverse and suddenly oh, he hadn't done it. (umm) Yeah clever the first time and then afterwards 

it just gets (umm) tiring. (umm) But {sigh} some of the acting was good but others 

terrible. (umm) Yeah I wouldn't recommend it, don't bother. I give it a two out of five.
