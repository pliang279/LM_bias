Hey Expo TV.

Today I'm here to talk about the movie Blind Mountain.

(uhh) This movie's about something you rarely rarely hear about. (umm) This is about (umm)

the slave trafficking, in (uhh) in particular Asia.

(umm) This movie's about

(umm) young individual who is captured and sold as a sexual slave. (umm) This is something that goes on with reasonable frequency (umm) especially in Eastern Asia. (umm) This boy is taken to a remote village in China and he kinda really sees no support from anywhere. He's kind of trapped

in this horrible, horrible cycle (umm) with with (stutter) no way out it seems. (umm) And the movie's really kind of just about white slavery or Asian slavery.

(umm) Instead of, you normally hear about (uhh) American slavery of the African Americans. (umm) But this movie kind of takes another direction and kind of opens your eyes to different issues in the world. (umm) As a movie overall, I thought the acting was poor. (umm) The story could have been filmed a lot better I think, because it's very interesting. I just think it's hard to make that work into a cohesive (umm) watchable (umm) story. (umm) So the story was definitely very poor how they did it.

(umm) If it was purely

(umm) (stutters) If it was purely historical, I think it would work. (uhh) Maybe to be shown in schools, something like that. But as a movie, (umm) it definitely falls short. So I'm gonna say one out of five stars, as a movie. As more of a documentary (umm) which it's not in that genre, but if it were, I would say three out of five stars.
