Hi everyone, today I'm doing my (stutter) review on this movie called The International. (umm) Clive Owens is in it and to be honest with you I don't remember it very much. I watched it about a week ago in theaters and it was so boring. It's supposed to be kind of this like thriller drama, but half the time I didn't know what was going on. (umm)

He basically is a detective or works for the law and is looking for this person and these people that are in charge of a bank that (umm) supposedly trying to kill people and murder people and get away with it. (umm) That's the main plot line. But he his (stutter) character didn't seem very strong. The supporting characters didn't seem very strong. The story line was kind of boring. So I would not recommend this to anybody to go in theaters and watch. I probably wouldn't (stutter) recommend it renting it either when it comes out on DVD. Maybe if it's on TV.
