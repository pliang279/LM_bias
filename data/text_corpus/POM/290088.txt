Hey everyone on ExpoTV dot com. Now today I'm going to be reviewing a movie in theaters called Fired Up.

Now I forget who this is starring but I'll give you a little summary of what the movie's about. It's about these two guys who are tired of summer football camps and decide to scheme and go to a cheerleading camp and obviously they're surrounded by all these young women and this guy, like they start falling for them and a bunch of stuff happens.

Now

overall

it wasn't really that funny. There was nothing really funny about it. They tried to use like sexual humor to get you to laugh but it didn't work. (umm) It had a lot, here let's see, it's

actually I'm not even gonna see. But (uhh) it's just overall

another one of these stupid movies. (uhh) it's nothing special, nothing worth seeing. The plot is basically like I said, the summary sums it up, so if that sounds interesting go watch it, I don't know. But obviously, I mean honestly I think that it was a terrible movie. It just left me, I left the theaters just completely yawning and bored and I don't know why I just spent my money so please do not waste your money watching this movie. I rate this movie two out of five.
