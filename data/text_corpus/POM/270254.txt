Hey everybody, this is Tom and today I'm going to be reviewing the movie Hancock. As always, bam, movie ticket, right there.

Out of the way. Alright, Hancock. It is a Will Smith attempt

at making a superhero movie in a summer of really good superhero movies. Iron Man, Incredible Hulk, Dark Knight.

Okay, as you can tell I'm doing this a little bit past the point when Hancock came out, but you see where I'm going with this. Hancock is not good. One, no one has ever heard of this, two, I hope nobody will remember this cause this was a bad movie. Okay, it had its funny points because it's about a bum on the streets who has superhuman abilities. And eventually he gets himself into trouble where he

(stutter) he ends up saving a public relations guy and he tries to build up his image to get people to like him. That is the story of this. (umm)

Okay the one thing that drove me nuts was the camera. Yes. Half the time the camera was doing three-sixties. So I think I kinda want to do the rest of this review doing nothing but three-sixties but that would drive you guys nuts, cause it drove me nuts. (uhh) Maybe I was the only one who noticed, who knows. (uhh) It it (stutter) was funny at times, but, you know, 

(stutter) it wasn't good enough for me. (stutter) No.

I I (stutter) didn't enjoy it, I I (stutter) just kind of sat there

"Hmm. Okay. This was funny. Why am I spending my money watching this?" {sigh}

I think I was more sad that I spent the money to watch this but (umm) otherwise it is funny enough to watch it, but not funny enough to watch it in theaters. Wait to rent it if you're really desperate, buy it if you want to.

(stutter) Don't know, it's more up to you. I'm going to give this a two out five, hope it helps. Thanks
