This DVD is Giuseppe Verdi's Rigoletto, which is an opera DVD if you don't know what that is and

(umm) I started getting into classical music and opera stuff and I find it easier to watch the opera than to listen to it on CD and

this one's pretty good. The sets are pretty impressive. It's from The Metropolitan Opera 

(umm) in New York 

and it has Placido Domingo who is probably one of the best opera singers around

and I believe this was filmed in the eighties or something like that. Maybe the end of the eighties 

and it's about two hours long, maybe a little bit longer. But it kept me captivated throughout the whole thing, which isn't always easy

(umm) in opera stuff. This definitely isn't for everyone. If you like opera you probably already know about this. If 

(umm) you just wanna check it out,

I'd recommend renting something like this cause this one is pretty entertaining compared to some of the other ones and I picked this up for probably about fifteen dollars.

Thank you.
