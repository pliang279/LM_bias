Hello. This review is on Transformers Three Three-D. And my family and I went and saw it at the beginning of the summer

and we've seen a couple other three-D movies before (uhh) but they honestly weren't very good three-D wise. (umm) But this one I have to say is definitely worth the extra money. (uhh) The movie in general (uhh) has a great story line. I liked it better than I liked the second one. (umm) We brought our kids with us and it was clean. (uhh) It wasn't bad at all.

It was very action packed. (uhh) The three-D effects (uhh) my son even said "ahh did you see that! It hit me!" So it, it (stutter) was a really, really good movie. I would recommend it. (uhh) It's worth paying the extra few dollars to see in three-D. (uhh) But in general just the storyline is a great story line, it has a lot of action featured areas in it that (uhh) just kind of keeps you on the edge of your seat. So I would recommend going to see Transformers Three and especially in three-D if you get the chance.
