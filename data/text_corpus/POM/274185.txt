Now I'm going to give you a review of Iron Man, the first big blockbuster hit of this summer. (uhh)

A comic book adaptation from Marvel starring Robert Downey Junior in the title role, and Jeff Bridges as the villain. (umm)

Iron Man is fantastic. One of the best (uhh) comic book adaptations to come out to date, surpassed maybe only by The Dark Knight (uhh) later this summer, even more recently. (umm)

The core of the movie is Robert Downey Junior's performance. He is simply brilliant as Tony Stark. (uhh) The the (stutter) wit and creativity that he brings to the role really carried the movie throughout, but it's not the only plus. (uhh) Jeff Bridges gives a reliably good performance as the counterpart villain (umm) to Tony Stark in the film's little corporate executive turned superhero supervillain battle. (umm)

And director Jon Favreau does an excellent job (uhh) shaping the action and putting together a story that really holds viewers attentions the whole way through. The movie never really sags, and has great supporting performances from Terrence Howard and Gwyneth Paltrow. (uhh) If you haven't managed to see it yet, you're probably going to have to wait for DVD which isn't too long, but it is absolutely a movie that you must see.
