Hi. (umm) today the product that I'm going to review is a DVD. This is Cold Mountain 

starring Jude Law, Nicole Kidman, and Renee Zellweger. This was the winner of 

the academy award (umm) best supporting actress, Renee Zellweger.

I hated this movie. {laughter} (umm)

I give it probably two stars just because of the actors that are in it, I like them. {laughter}

But if they didn't have those actors I would give it a one. 

The story is about (umm) the civil war and how this town, I believe it's called, (uhh) it's Cold Mountain (umm) in North Carolina. 

And (umm) the men of Cold Mountain decide to go and join the the (stutter) war. (umm) 

the story is mainly about Nicole Kidman and Renee Zellweger as they try to survive through the war and wait for their loved ones to come back.

It's 

xxx a stupid film. I hate it. Nicole Kidman kind of goes cuckoo during the movie. 

(umm) {laughter} there's battle scenes and it's

it's (stutter) not a movie that I like. But 

if you're interested in watching this at all you can find at any Best Buy, Walmart, (umm) even online at Amazon dot com for under twenty dollars.
