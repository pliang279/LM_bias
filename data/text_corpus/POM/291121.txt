Hi Expo, today I wanna do a movie review for you of a movie currently in theaters and that is Confessions of a Shopaholic. And I have my ticket stub here for Confessions of a Shopaholic. Confessions of a Shopaholic is (umm) based on a series of novels (stutter) by Sophie Consella. (umm) And it is about a girl named Becky Bloomwood who is obsessed with shopping.

This particular film (umm) I've read the novels and they're really good I guess you could say chick lit. (umm) Very fluffy, very entertaining, but this movie was absolutely awful. (umm) 

Which, I think you can kind of tell from the previews it's gonna be not so funny. (umm) In the novels Becky Bloomwood is, you know,

I think that her character is a little bit smarter but in this movie she comes off as very dumb. And the message at the end of the movie isn't very good. (umm) I don't think. And it's just over the top and the character of Becky is just not very strong and the acting I also thought was not very good (umm)

(umm) for that character. I would definitely recommend that if you've read the shopaholic books to absolutely not go see this movie, and if you haven't read the shopaholic books too absolutely not go see this movie cuz it's it's it's (stutter)

really awful. I (umm) it doesn't have a good message, no good characters, the characters are portrayed as dumb (umm) and over the top, so don't go see it. Do not go see Confessions of a Shopaholic.
