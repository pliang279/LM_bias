This is a review for (uhh) The Boondock Saints. 

It's a (umm) action movie. (umm) Some people sort of (uhh) compare it to Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels. 

(uhh) It's (stutter) a good movie. I would recommend it (uhh) for anyone that likes those type of movies (uhh) it's got some good actors in it and it's Willem Dafoe. 

(umm) 

It, it's (stutter) a tremendously 

violent, somewhat gory, a little bit of nudity in it I think they give it an R rating, 

(uhh) which is (uhh) you know, fairly warranted. (uhh) 

It's ninety-seven minutes long (uhh) so it's not a super long movie, not super short. 

(uhh) But it's, it's (stutter) good in that it 

keeps you on your toes, there's a little plot twist, it's well directed, it's got a nice (uhh) 

style to it, it's you know, 

(uhh) got it, a certain feel to it that (uhh) it just makes it a good movie, I (uhh) recommend it for that. (uhh) 

{cough} (stutter) The movie hasn't been (uhh) I believe it wasn't given a theatrical release and so most people haven't seen it. (uhh) 

I'm not sure why but I think it definitely warrants (uhh) 

watching it.
