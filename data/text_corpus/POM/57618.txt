Hi, I'm here with The Matrix Revolutions. 

This is the final movie in the Matrix Trilogy. 

I'm giving this movie a two out of five. I love the first Matrix, the second Matrix had amazing action and special effects and I liked it too. However I did not like this third movie. I felt they could have ended the trilogy so much better. Almost the entire movie was like 

(stutter) two battles. One in the real world and one in the matrix

and

it (stutter) didn't feel like that much happened in this movie. The movie just felt like really short and (stutter) the ending just wasn't that good. The dialogue was pretty bad. Keanu Reeves Keanu Reaves' acting was like a lot worse than the first two movies.

He has a lot of one-liners and he's confused a lot of the movie.

(uhh) {clears throat} 

He (stutter) doesn't show a lot of emotion.

(uhh) There's this one fight with Neo and Agent Smith that like (stutter) there was like a billion Agent Smiths but he only fought one so it was kind of disappointing cause I I (stutter) thought it would be a crazy fight with every Agent Smith against Neo, but no, it was just one. (umm)

And that fight was kind of disappointing. It was basically a rip-off of Dragon Ball Z. (umm)

The DVD has some extra features, some behind the scenes stuff but I don't think that makes it worth buying. (uhh) 

If you watch the first movies you should get (stutter) rent this movie just to watch it but I do not recommend anyone buying this. xxxx
