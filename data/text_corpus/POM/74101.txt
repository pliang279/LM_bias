Hi. (umm) Today's product that I'm gonna review is a DVD. It's called Dreamgirls starring Beyonce Knowles, Jennifer Hudson, Jamie Foxx, (umm)

several other different famous (umm) people. 

But this {clears throat} is the story about (umm) three girls' dreams to become singers

and (uhh) 

it, it (stutter) won (umm) some Academy Awards

I don't like this movie. (umm) There's a lot of singing in it, which isn't bad, I love musicals. But (umm) 

just the whole story line was

I I (stutter) didn't care for it. (umm) It was about Jamie Foxx of course played sort of a bad guy who (umm),

you know, used kind of used (stutter) the girls against one another to get rich and (umm) get popular.

And I I (stutter) just didn't care for the movie. The whole plot line was

(umm)

just silly and stupid. 

But if you're interested in owning this {laugh} (umm) you can find it on Amazon dot com and even at Walmart or Target for under twenty dollars.
