Hello, I'm Matthew I'm here to tell you about this dvd. This is Kiss Kiss Bang Bang.

(umm) It stars Robert Downey Junior and Val Kilmer.

(umm) This is a great movie (umm) if you like movies like Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels or Snatch, (umm) I think you will enjoy this movie. (umm) This is a comedy (umm) it's also has some action in it, and (umm)

it's just a really fun movie. (umm) It's kind of a guy movie so maybe your girlfriend might not like it, (umm) it depends on what type of movie she likes. (umm) But this is just a hilarious movie. (umm) The acting was great, I really like both actors that are in this movie. (umm)

It has lots of bonus features (umm) with a
