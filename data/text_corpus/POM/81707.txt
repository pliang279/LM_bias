I'll be reviewing the dvd of the work of director Michael Gondry. Now this is a (uhh) 

much, pretty a series 

(uhh) clearly focusing on (umm) a music video directors. (uhh) Well Gondry's one of the first one they did. 

It was a really awesome choice (umm) he's one of my favorite directors just out, even outside of music videos. You know he's probably most notable for 

(uhh) Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind was his you know, kind of debut (uhh) feature film.  

This is just, if you liked that movie then you probably check up, definitely check this out even if you don't like the kind of music you know (uhh) he (uhh) he  directed for (uhh) the videos are amazing, just the, you know the level  of creativity 

you know he shows you've seen it Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind you know exactly what I'm talking about this is kind of really out there. 

You know, visual style while they're you know, animating videos with your stop motion legos. 

Or (uhh) I I (stutter) really don't want to even really say that much you know it's it's (stutter) just awesome some of the things he does. 

(umm) A lot of the music featured in this, it's a lot of techno (uhh) except maybe it's not quite so mainstream. He's done a lot of Bjork videos 

(uhh) a number of (uhh) White Stripes, 

(uhh) some Daft Punk, some Chemical Brothers (umm). 

Music wise it's not super to my taste 

(uhh) but just, 

you know I do I do (stutter) enjoy a lot of it 

(uhh) but just visually it's it's (stutter) worth owning. (umm) You know it also includes (uhh) a couple short films of his a couple stories, you know that kind of thing. 

It's just really, really cool just to own if you're a, you know if you're a fan of his, you know of his direction you know since he broke into feature films just want to see kind of his older stuff you know or if kind of, you know, where he got his start.
