Hi, today I'm presenting the movie Pride, which is playing in theaters right now. 

It has (uhh) Tom Arnold, 

(umm) Bernie Mac and a guy named (stutter) Terrance Howard.

(umm) I'm not really sure who he is, (umm) but he's the lead actor.

(umm) It's about this guy who starts, finds kind of like this abandon pool, and starts like a 

(umm) swimming team for troubled youth and 

(umm) I would not recommend this movie. It was absolutely terrible. The acting was terrible. It wasn't very good at all. It would just be a waste of money.

(umm) It also got terrible reviews from professional critics as well.

(uhh) I don't know why I went to go see it.

(uhh) I thought it looked interesting. 

(umm) But yeah, it's a terrible terrible movie and it's a waste of time.

(umm) It's not a very like, the story line wasn't very good and 

(umm) the acting seemed kind of corny. The lines they used like, doesn't really seem like real life stuff.

(umm) They tried to make it like 

inspirational kind of thing but not really. So

I wouldn't recommend going to see Pride.
