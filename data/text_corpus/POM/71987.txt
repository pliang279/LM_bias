This is (stutter) Sleepy Hollow starring Johnny Depp and Christina Ricci.

This, (stutter) Johnny plays Ichabod Crane.

He is, I guess, (hmm) I guess you could call him

a part of xxx of xxx (stutter) that it was before his time really. 

He is a weird person in his odd, well strange and weird person in this particular boo-boo.

He (uhh)

he's trying to figure out

who

the headless horseman really is

and

who is going around killing all the people

in this particular movie.

he he (stutter) but he don't he don't like the fire bud.

Put it like that.

So this particular movie, you just have to watch it and see how it ends up.

But this particular disc right here has (stutter) special features in it.

It has the widescreen version of it, the (stutter) enhanced for six by nine.

It also has the interactive media.

You'll have to watch it and see all the special features it has.
