Hi, (uhh) today the product that I'm going to review is a DVD.

This is a Walt Disney DVD called The Princess Diaries Two: Royal Engagement. Of course starring Anne Hathaway as the first one. As well as Julie Andrews.

And this story is about (umm)

how

the girl Anne Hathaway has now grown up and graduated college and now she's going back to Genovia to live and to become queen of Genovia.

Along the way (umm)

there, 

both Anne Hathaway's character and Julie Andrews' character finds out that there's some sort of like clause to becoming

queen of Genovia.

Is that she has to marry a prince by her twenty-first birthday or before she becomes (umm) crowned. So it's about them trying to find her a guy to become engaged to so that she can become queen of Genovia.

But it's a cute little story. (umm)

You can find this on amazon dot com or (stutter) Disney dot com for under twenty dollars.
