This is a review for the movie Legend. 

(umm) This is the 

ultimate edition 

DVD. 

(umm) The director was Ridley Scott 

and it starred Tom Cruise 

and Mia Sarah. 

(umm) It's actually kind of an older movie I believe it was back in like 

eighty-four or something like that. 

(umm) 

This particular DVD set is really cool because it has two different versions of the movie. 

Cuz it turns out that the theatrical release for it (umm) had completely different soundtrack 

and (umm) there were a lot of scenes cut out of it. 

So 

(umm) this (uhh) 

set, it includes the theatrical release 

which we all 

grew up on I'm sure. And then (umm) 

the other DVD is actually the original version (uhh) the director's cut 

with the original soundtrack and all of the scenes that had been

omitted. 

So I think that is totally awesome. 

(umm) The movie itself is very cool. (uhh) 

It's it's (stutter) a fantasy. 

(umm) 

It has like unicorns and this big old like, 

devil looking dude who is actually Tim Curry, 

so that's kind of cool. 

(umm) 

It's my favorite movie ever and I recommend it to everyone. {laughter}
