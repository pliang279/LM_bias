Hi my name is Anesh and today I'm reviewing the movie Step Up Two The Streets. (umm)

Well my friend actually just wanted to go watch this movie so I accompanied him and I still don't know why I wasted one and a half hours of my life. (umm) So the movie you know you can see the trailer and you can just tell that there are these bunch of guys and girls who wanna just dance around and. (umm) None of them noted actors or actresses and as it turned out you know that the acting was terrible, the storyline was terrible too. It was just you know, dancing. So anyone who likes all that street dancing all those moves, (umm) crazy stuff. Go to, go and watch it. I mean,

I don't see how it's different from all those MTV shows. (umm) But you know, in this you can actually do a lot of stuff (umm) you know, camera wise you don't actually have to do it on the street itself so I guess that's why they plan to make a movie out of it. (umm)

I don't like it at all, I mean I like dancing, but you know like two minutes of it, maybe five minutes of it, I can't (umm) really see the whole movie with dancing around and (umm) you know, otherwise the performance acting wise, dialog wise it was terrible. So I'll just rate this movie two on five maybe. (umm) And again it's for only those people who like to see people dance. Crazily dance you know that street dance. (umm) That's about it. (umm)

So yeah, rating two for Step Up Two The Streets.
