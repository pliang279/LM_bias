This is a review for (uhh) Kung Pow 

Enter the Fist. 

(umm) This is a Steve Oederek movie 

and (uhh) basically what happens in this movie is they've taken an old (uhh) 

seventies (uhh) Kung Fu movie and they've redone the dubbing for it. 

And they've also inserted new scenes. 

And it's actually really funny. If you remember a few years ago when the commercials for this were on, (uhh) 

the commercials made it seem terrible, 

and I don't blame most people for not wanting to see it cuz I, it didn't look good. 

(umm) But what I can say is that the things that were in the commercials were probably the least funny parts of the movie. (umm) 

It's got lots of like, really stupid humor but it also has a lot of things that just take you off guard like with how (uhh) amusing they are. 

(uhh) That being said, 

I'm always telling my friends how funny it is and every time I sit down to watch it with them, I find myself be, becoming (stutter) intensely embarassed that I find anything in it funny, 

and I, I have a really hard time getting through it. 

But then later on when I remember back to the movie and all I can remember is it just being absolutely hilarious. (umm) 

So you may or may not like this 

(uhh) I did. (umm)

But I can recommend it, it's a funny movie.
