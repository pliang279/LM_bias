Hi (uhh) this is a review of Next 

which (uhh) stars Nicolas Cage, Julianne Moore, (uhh) 

Jessica Biel all those guys. (uhh) 

It's (uhh) 

has a pretty cool premise 

seeing in the future that sort of thing but (umm) 

wasn't executed very well, it was (uhh) 

pretty, pretty (stutter) poor movie. (umm) 

Thought that (uhh) 

could have been a lot better. 

The acting (uhh) was {laughter} 

pretty ridiculous at times 

and 

it's just. 

It was, it was (stutter) a pretty boring movie. 

I would definitely not watch it again. 

(umm) 

I don't recommend that you do, either. 

(uhh) 

Get anything else. 

(uhh) It's boring. 

It was nonsensical at times. 

It's 

not possible, (uhh) can't suspend beliefs that much. 

(uhh) Two out of five.
