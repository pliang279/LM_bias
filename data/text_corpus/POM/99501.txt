Hey. Today I'm going to be reviewing the two disc special edition of The Hulk

widescreen. This (uhh) is a pretty ridiculous movie. It covers the story of the Hulk, a man who is (uhh) a scientist exposed to gamma radiation and then ever since that exposure when he becomes angry he turns into the Hulk, a huge green (uhh) monster man with (uhh) unlimited power and invulnerability, and with the added feature that the angrier the Hulk gets the more powerful and more invulnerable he becomes. 

So basically it's a,

it's a story, this is a story about a man who who (stutter) 

suffers because he can't control his anger, but also uses this anger to lash out at society and his oppressors. 

The movie kind of glosses over a lot of the (uhh) (stutter) a lot of the things that you could say with a story like that in favor of just pure action. The Hulk smashing tanks and smashing helicopters and jumping thousands of miles, and while that's entertaining it's I also don't think that's enough. I think you could have done a little bit more with this movie, with the subject matter. But portraying him as a tortured soul a little bit better, I don't know. But as it is, it's a,

it's a (stutter) fairly entertaining movie but very, very brainless. (uhh) The special effects are nice, but not enough to warrant

any kind of purchase or rental. I kind of wish I didn't have this. I give it a two. It's, 

it's not as bad as, as (stutter) a one but like I said there's very, very little here to reclaim it and make it valuable. I give it a two.
