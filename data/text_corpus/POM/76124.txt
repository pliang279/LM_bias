Hey guys, this is Tay here and I'm going to review the very unexciting movie Stigmata.

(uhh) This (umm) you can call it pretty much an exorcism movie. You've got (uhh) Patricia Arquette I believe, yes, and she (umm)

plays this woman right here who gets a little possessed in the movie. She's a hairdresser then she, you know, 

like I said gets possessed and you got all these crazy satanic shenanigans going on. (umm) The plot if you ask me is kind of hollow, there's not that much going on. You've got like the typical priest guy that's trying to help her out and so forth and he gets caught up in all this stuff, maybe even falls in love with her or something like that. It's this thing, you know I don't really want to go beyond that in (uhh) describing this plot of the stigmata it's just like when you get like living wounds of like the same stuff that Christ had. So you get like hanging from the arm and the feet and so forth and that she gets to start out with, and that's what begins the possession. 

(umm) This right here has got some special features including (umm) an alternate ending which is pretty interesting, we were watching that. Audio commentary from the director and deleted scenes and also a music video by Natalie Imbruglia. So, 

see now I didn't like this movie that much, I gave it two out of five stars, so if you like this movie it's a pretty good DVD to get because you got a lot of special features. Check it out.
