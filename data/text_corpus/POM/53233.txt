Hey y'all how's it going my name is Jordan and (uhh) today I'm gonna be reviewing the dvd The Shawshank Redemption. Now this is actually one of my favorite movies, I really really enjoyed this movie. It's really long but (umm) it's a really, really great movie I definitely recommend you need to see it. (umm) It it (stutter) was definitely a great movie I enjoyed it. I'm not sure if it won any academy awards or anything, but (umm)

I'm not, but but (stutter) it should have. If it didn't it, then it definitely should have, I was looking to see if it did but I don't think it did. But (umm) but yeah, this is a really, really great movie, I would definitely recommend that you see it. (umm) The actors do a great job, it has an original storyline that's (umm) really great. It's it's  (stutter) a really great movie. (umm)

It doesn't have a lot of parts that (umm) could be bad but it's it's (stutter) definitely rated R for a reason and you don't wanna you know, take your kids to see it or anything like that, you definitely wanna watch this first and make sure it's okay. But (umm) but yeah, so this is a really, really great movie. I I (stutter) just can't I really enjoy it a lot. (umm) This is one of my favorites. But (umm) but as far as special features go there are not hardly any special features at all. This is actually the basic (umm) Shawshank Redemption (umm) dvd it pretty much just comes with the disc. (umm) Not really any special features at all, there's a play button (umm) and then some audio stuff but that's about it. But (umm) you really (stutter) it really doesn't matter, you really wanna purchase this just for the movie, the movie is great. (umm) You'll definitely love it. (umm) So go get this, this is the Shawshank Redemption and (umm) yeah. Y'all go get this one.
