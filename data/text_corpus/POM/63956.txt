Hi, this is a review for the movie Hot Fuzz, now in theaters.

Wow

This is a hilarious movie. I strongly recommend it. It's made by the same people that made the  movie Shaun of the Dead. It's the same actors, they wrote the Shaun of the Dead and they wrote this one. 

Wow, it's great. It's it's (stutter) a comedy and it's also

a bad ass cop movie. 

Pretty much anything you would want to see in a super action packed cop movie, it's in there and it's also full of great humor. You know, making fun of stuff.

And 

It's it's (stutter) great. The acting's good in it, 

it's funny, it's got you know

lots of action, lots of good stuff.

If you like cop movies and you like comedies and you liked the movie Shaun of the Dead,

I strongly recommend you go see Hot Fuzz, now in theaters.

Thank you very much

and

go to the movie, right now. Go to the movie. Go to the movie. Go to the movie. Go to the movie. 

Okay, go to the movie.
