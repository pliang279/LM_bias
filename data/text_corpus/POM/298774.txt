Hi there, I'm Alexis and I'm doing a review on My Sister's Keeper. This movie is playing out in theaters and it is very good. I would give it a five star rating. And

(umm) basically the movie is PG-thirteen it's one hour and forty-six minutes. (umm)

There are very good actresses and actors in this movie. And I was very impressed with the film. (uhh) There's Abigail Breslin, Cameron Diaz, Sofia Vassilieva and Jason Patrick. And they all play very, very good. (umm)

I was just really impressed with this movie and I recommend it to many people. One thing that I should warn you about is the movie will probably make you cry throughout the whole film. Because it's about this little girl who is dying from leukemia

and there are just (umm)

the family, it (umm) is just getting torn apart. And there's just a lot of the drama going on and (umm)

it's a wonderful storyline, really really interesting and (umm) it will just keep you on the edge of your seat the whole movie. It's very, very good and I am so impressed with how it turned out. There's also a bestselling book called My Sister's Keeper and that's why they have the movie and (umm)

it's just so good, so. Go watch it, I mean I just want everyone to see it because it's just so serious you can see how (umm)

you can watch a girl, a little kid going through leukemia and it's just so sad but. I mean, it just shows you right there and.

I mean that stuff really gets to you and it was pretty serious, so (umm)

I think that many people should see it so that you can see how serious leukemia is and how much it affects the family. And all that, so

yeah. It just, it opened my eyes to life and like opened my eyes to a different view on life and I know that it would open many views to other peoples and people. (umm)

Different perspectives on things so (umm) it's definitely worth watching.
