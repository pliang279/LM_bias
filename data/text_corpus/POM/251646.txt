Hello. Today I would like to review for you a movie currently in theaters called Mad Money. It stars Ted Danson, Queen Latifah, and (uhh) Diane Keaton.

(umm)

It's basically, it's a light comedy. It's sort of like an adult contemporary comedy. (umm)

It's about (uhh) these three women that that (stutter) work for the national reserve and (umm) they're just like, you know, normal women, they're not like (uhh)

thieves or gangsters or anything like that. They're just, you know, your normal everyday women. And they're plotting to steal (uhh) this money that's going to be destroyed by the national reserve cause (stutter) of course the national reserve controls the money and, you know, sometimes money just has to be destroyed. So (umm) they plot to steal this money for themselves and,

you know, comedy ensues. So it's, like I said it's a light comedy so

it was, when the movie was over I was somewhat pleased and entertained but it was sort of one of those take it or leave it kind of things. (umm) It's a very forgettable film and like the casting isn't that great. Like Ted Danson is in it so, I mean, if that says anything then

I know you know what I'm talking about, but yeah. (uhh) Mad Money, (uhh), it's okay. If you're in the mood for a light comedy, if there's nothing else playing at the theater. Otherwise it's not really worth, you know, nine or ten bucks or whatever it costs to see a movie at your theater.
