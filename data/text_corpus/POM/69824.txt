Hey there Expo TV goers.

I just witnessed a terrible movie that was called TMNT, or Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles as they used to call it when it was good.

This is a computer animated version of our beloved turtles and it is nowhere near as good as those great, early nineties, real life Ninja Turtles cheese fests.

This Turtles movie is terrible and it has the worst plot and cliche, collecting orbs and stuff

xxx I've ever seen in my life.

And there's (uhh)

the chick is like

has like a staff and she hits people with it.

And I hated it and animation was pretty terrible. Looks like a video game cut scene, with the exception of one rain fight which was pretty cool.

(umm) All the catch phrases were there, Splinter was there, he was cool, but

I didn't really like it. 

So, don't see it. Bye.
