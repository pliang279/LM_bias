Right here with me right now I have this (uhh) movie called Aeon Flux. (uhh) 

This is basically a very, very (uhh) 

high action, action packed sort of like The Matrix kind of movie. 

(uhh) It's where this girl here (uhh) 

she goes around and she's trying to overthrow 

the government or {cough} or the society 

that she lives in, 

in which, it everything is perfect, everything is run (uhh) perfectly. 

Which is really, really like a stifling (stutter) claustrophobic feeling it gives you. 

And (uhh) 

she uses all a acrobatic fighting moves and everything to 

overthrow this government. (uhh) 

I think it's really interesting, it's really cool to see 

(uhh) all these movies and everything. 

(uhh) Sort of like The Matrix was at first. However, 

just as The Matrix more matrixes came out it kinda got boring, kinda got old. 

(uhh) This movie towards the end it kind of gets a little bit old. (uhh) 

All the moves and everything like that, so 

(uhh) though it's a good action thing it's not, doesn't have an amazing story 

and it's a lot of (uhh) just the action and (uhh) 

if you're into that sort of thing I would recommend getting this but if you're looking for something deeper I wouldn't suggest getting this movie.
