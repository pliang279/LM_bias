Hi everybody today I'm reviewing the (uhh) VHS copy of Star Trek: Insurrection. Starring the (uhh) the next generation it has (uhh) (uhh)

all all (stutter) the characters which I can't remember the {Laughter} names. But (uhh) it's (uhh) really this is a negative review this is one that I am sad to say I really like star trek, I liked all the spinoffs, star trek, star trek the next generation. And a lot of the movies but Insurrection was a stinker. (uhh) It was horrible I can't recommend it. (uhh) This was given to me I would not have bought it. (uhh) It's it's (stutter) sad to say I mean you know I watched it out of curiosity just to see what was going on and and (stutter) (uhh) it's just just (stutter) a really bad story, that's all there is to it. You know the effects are (uhh) these days there's just nothing that wows you. It's (uhh) nothing unusual but it is not always about effects it's about the storyline and the storyline is just boring. So (uhh) I can't recommend this and I certainly wouldn't buy it.

But have a good day anyway.
