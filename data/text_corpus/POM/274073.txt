Hello expo TV, today I'll be reviewing the movie (uhh) The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon (umm) Tomb of the Dragon Emperor. So this movie is basically a simple version of (uhh)

so, in this part what they have done is they basically shift their focus from Egypt to (uhh) China near to the Great Wall of China. So, in this one with Brendan Fraser is shown as (umm) an old guy and (uhh) he has a son, grown-up son, who is an archaeologist.

And and (stutter) he basically fell for Chinese girl (uhh) who wanted to protect the

basically I don't, I want to say this thing, but (uhh)

So this movie is all about (uhh) the same thing, instead of the mummy from Egypt, they're now looking for a mummy in (umm) China. (uhh) It's about an emperor, who was really powerful in (umm) era a lot and {clears throat}

he is he is (stutter) almost conquered the world, but some somebody (stutter) basically stopped him and make him (uhh) give him (umm) kind of trapped him in his body and. So this, the friend, Fraser's son was (uhh) searching for that tomb and basically found that that there was an army like

(umm) an evil army as always (uhh) who want to take advantage of that. So this thing all happened in (uhh) {clears throat} really fast manner, so I would say that movie was not as comparable as Mummy and Mummy's Return (uhh) because I didn't this one as much because it seems that you are watching the same movie, but

like all the action, per scene, there was not much of a difference that all people are rising from the grave, and so. (uhh)

and {clears throat}

there are like lot of new character being introduced in the movie. You'd see that there are like big gorillas, snowmen, or so that was kind of a weird thing, so I'll say that this movie was just just (stutter) an okay movie and I'm going to give this movie like two out of five.

Again expo TV, I reviewed for the movie The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor.
