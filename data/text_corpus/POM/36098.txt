Hello, I'm here to tell you about this

crazy movie Sasquatch Mountain.

This was just released recently. It was made for Sci-Fi. 

(uhh) This movie pretty much reeked.

(uhh) It has the typical Sci-Fi story line where they're out in the woods and

there's monsters

killing them one by one and

you know. The typical Sci-Fi channel movie. 

(umm) This movie was just pretty corny. The graphics are bad and 

everything, the acting. I think there's maybe one or two good actors in this movie that are in some other 
popular movies. But this movie

really stunk and it's not really that entertaining. I don't really recommend you watch it, but if you wanna make fun of it then I'd watch it.

But you can get this anywhere and it's probably about

fifteen dollars, ten dollars

and

I guess watch it and see for yourself.
