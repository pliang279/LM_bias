This is Dustin and today I'm reviewing The Good Shepherd, with Robert De Niro, Matt Damon and Angelina Jolie.

It's a story about when the CIA basically came into effect and how it came into effect and some of the major events that led to this, mostly dealing with the Cuban missile crisis and the Cold War.

(umm) Basically in this movie Matt Damon is a CIA agent and 

it goes through the effects that it has on his life of how secretive it is and everything and

(umm) having to keep the secrets even from his family and how this ruins his family life basically and 

(umm) about how the US government is corrupt 

(uhh) in a way and and (stutter) (uhh) interfere with other country's affairs and everything. Overall this movie wasn't very good. It lacked action.I mean it had a story but it was very 

(uhh) drawn out. The movie is two hours and forty minutes. 

(uhh) I would give it a two out of five.
