Hi Expo Tv. We have today 

one of my favorite James Bond movies. 

The Living Daylights. 

Featuring Timothy Dalton 

as 

double oh seven, James Bond. 

Well this is a very fast paced movie with plenty of action, suspense, gunfights, 

horse chases, big machinery shooting at each other, airplanes. 

It's got basically everything you could want in a James Bond movie. 

Timothy Dalton is actually a pretty good James Bond character, he (uhh) fits the role well. 

He (uhh) has a good (stutter) personality for it, he brings a lot of humor 

to it. (uhh) He fits the role very well I liked him in it. 

(uhh) This James Bond movie also has I think one of the best James Bond theme songs, 

(uhh) called the living daylights of course

by a group I'd never heard of 

and I'm pretty sure it's their only song. 

But it's still a good song. 

So if the song made the movie, 

this is a five out of five. 

But the song doesn't make the movie, 

but it still gets five out of five 

because it has good plot, good suspense, good action, humor, it's got it all. 

Good James Bond. 

Five out of five stars, both thumbs up. 

Quality movie.
