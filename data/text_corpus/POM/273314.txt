I'm reviewing Shopgirl the DVD.

It is a movie made off of Steve Martin's novella that he (stutter) wrote and it is about a girl that is torn between two lovers and she can't really decide between which one, the rich old man or the young man. (umm) Neither of them are really going anywhere.

And I would not recommend this movie. It is a rated R movie and it has lots of sex. Not really that much in the language department but it was just

a very

blah movie and it was supposed to be a romantic comedy but I didn't see that it was funny in any way and it was not a movie that I would recommend for anybody to go

see. So

if you like Steve Martin even, it's not the Steve Martin that you would

think you're getting. It is maybe more of the Steve Martin that is in

(umm) that movie

I can't think of what it's called, not Grand Canyon but

anyway. (umm)

About people in LA but I've lost what I'm gonna say.

LA Story? Anyway (umm) not recommended by me.
