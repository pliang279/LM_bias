Hey what's up you guys. So right now I'm here to review the movie three hundred and holy crap was it amazing. I totally loved it.

(umm) It was definitely one of the most action packed movies I've seen in a really really long time, and I mean a really long time. Maybe like, you know, past year year and a half. 

(umm) I love the movie Troy, I don't know if you remember that or not but it was a really good movie.

(umm) And that used to be one of my favorite fighting movies up until three hundred, and three hundred to be honest was like Troy on steroids. It was that great. I, I fell in love with it. Like, I watched it like two times in like

(uhh) the week it came out it was so good. 

And 

like it has so much action. The graphics you know I don't remember if you remember the movie Sin City or not but 

(uhh) it's that kind of 

(uhh) that's how it looks. That's all you gotta know. I guess a new age of 

(uhh) movie making 

(uhh) technology. And but like yeah, that makes it all look better. It just makes it, the colors were different. They were kinda, I don't know, I don't know how to describe it. But yeah, you have to take a look for yourself. But

honestly the plot was amazing, the graphics, the fighting scenes were the best.

(umm) Everything like just, I totally loved it. The acting was amazing too. It was that great. 

I can't even like you know, describe to you how great it was.

(umm) But yeah, so you should definitely go see the movie. You'd love it, especially guys. I don't know if girls would like it that much but guys would definitely love it, trust me.

So yeah, go check out three hundred.
