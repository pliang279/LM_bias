Hi today I'm going to be reviewing 

Jerry Maguire starring Tom Cruise. 

(umm) It's also costarring Cuba Gooding junior and 

(uhh) Renee Zellweger. 

(uhh) So this movie's about a (stutter) sports agent named Jerry Maguire. 

And he's kind of a, a (stutter) bigshot 

(umm) but he ends up losing one of his (umm) premier athletes to (uhh) a different 

agent and then he (uhh) kind of goes against company policy, leaves it behind and goes (uhh) 

becomes an independent agent.

He only has one client and (umm) one loyal colleague who is (umm) Renee Zellweger. 

They end up kind of becoming a couple and (uhh) 

It's really a great movie. 

Don't wanna spoil the ending for you. 

But anyway (umm) Cuba Gooding junior won best supporting actor for this movie 

and it was nominated for five academy awards so 

(uhh) it's a pretty pretty (stutter) great movies and there's some pretty classic lines in this one. 

So if you haven't seen it you definitely want to check it out and it's Jerry Maguire starring Tom Cruise.
