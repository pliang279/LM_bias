Hey ExpoTV, this is a review on the movie Because of Winn-Dixie. (umm) This disc. 

(umm) It's, it's a very cute movie (umm) the dog is really

it basically follows the book. (umm) The book is one of my all-time favorites, the actress Anna Sophia, she is, she's really good, she's like the next Dakota Fanning, I think. (umm) Southern, takes place down south, it's a very southern movie (umm) everybody's got a little accent to them. (umm) Dave Matthews is in it, which is basically the reason why I watched it. I love him in this movie. (umm) I actually wished there were more Dave Matthews songs featured in the movie, (umm) I thought there would be I was kind of disappointed that there weren't but the rest of the movie made up for it, it's very cute, very much like the book, no surprises, nothing crazy, nothing big. (umm)

I think it's a great movie to watch with the family, kids probably will love it (umm)

it's it's (stutter) good, it's a good movie (umm). Lots of life lessons to learn. And I think it's one that every kid will enjoy. And any dog lover.
