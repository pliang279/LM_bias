What up guys, this is Cade and I'm doing a review of

the Blade Trinity. This is the third (umm) installment in the Blade series, the movie is the final one, and this is the special unrated version. 

With the unrated version what you get is pretty much as it says on the back ten more minutes of action. So you got an extra fight scene right there, it's really long and probably just a couple of slow motion stuff going on so not exactly the best extra. But yeah, also the movie itself isn't very good. It's pretty much, you know, (stutter) Wesley Snipes playing the vampire hunter Blade and it's from the Ghost Rider comic books. And he hunts for vampires and instead in this one he's joined by these people, there's more people in the team but these are the main ones that we're focused upon and they just go around killing vampires. 

This one didn't have sort of the dark feeling that the first two (umm) Blade films have, it's more just like action oriented. I felt like I was watching Triple X or something like that so it's not exactly very high on my list of action films. So overall I give (umm) Blade Trinity a two because it's a little entertaining, but man, overall it's definitely not as good as the first two by any means. So check it out only if you're a diehard fan.
