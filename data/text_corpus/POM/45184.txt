Hi, today I'm presenting a movie opinion on a movie that's in theaters right now called 

The Hills Have Eyes Two. 

(umm) I thought this movie was really, really bad. 

(umm) It's supposed to be scary and stuff, but I didn't really feel scared, it was just like 

a lot of goriness and stuff to it. 

(umm) I didn't really like the acting, I didn't really know anybody that was in it, so 

(umm) I thought it would be scary (umm) the previews made it look like that but it really wasn't. 

(umm) It's about these like, (uhh) 

like (stutter) training guys that are (uhh) in the desert and on their last day they get attacked by these mutants. 

(umm) They're national guard trainees, and (umm) I don't think like it's not very good, it's not very gore, like the goriness sucks, the acting sucks, 

(umm) the storyline sucks, it's just like one of those like, 

(uhh) like, (stutter)

there it's like a typical horror film that they tried to make scary and stuff but I didn't really feel 

like it was like that at all. It was just bad and a waste of money, so don't go see The Hills Have Eyes Two.
