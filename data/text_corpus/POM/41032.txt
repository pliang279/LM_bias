I'm gonna do a video review today on the movie Escape to Witch Mountain.

This movie is a great movie to watch. It's ninety seven minutes long and you wish there were more minutes added to it cause it's such a good movie.

And it's about two little kids, a brother and a sister, that have brain power.

They can move stuff,

they can float, they can do all kinds of cool stuff and it's just a cool movie to watch, especially if you're a little kid.

And what's good about this is, this particular movie has special features.

It has a audio commentary with Ike Eisman, John Hu and Kim Richards, they were actors in the movie.

It also has a cartoon, Pluto's Dream House, that's included in the movie.

(uhh) Making the escape, they have the making of the movie. It's all on this one DVD.

It has a nineteen seventy five Disney Studio album.

It has a conversation with John Hu.

(uhh) It's digitally mastered and it has special effects, something that the first movie didn't have.

So I highly recommend this movie.

And probably the best place to get this, since it's a Disney DVD 

and they don't always have these available in stores. They'll put em out every so often to celebrate anniversaries or whatever. 

But you can go to DisneyDVD dot com to pick this movie up, and I highly recommend it.
