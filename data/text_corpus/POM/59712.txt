Hi, ExpoTV. This is user QTPie here. And I'm reviewing a movie many of you have probably heard of before or maybe seen. It is a movie based off of a TV show, Jackass The Movie.

This is probably one of my favorite movies. It's absolutely hilarious. (umm) It's easily in my top ten. This is the special collector's edition in widescreen. 

(umm) Basically, what this show is is a group of guys go out, cause trouble, and (uhh) do skits  on people. (uhh) It's pretty funny. 

(umm) This is what the disc looks like. It's got the (uhh) Jackass skull and (uhh) what is this called again? Crutches, the skull and crutches. 

(umm) Some of my favorite scenes in this is (umm) probably the off road tattoo, which is where Steve-O goes into a Humvee off road and gets a tattoo while they're going over all these huge bumps. And also

(umm) another hilarious one is (umm) Steve-O puts a (uhh) bottle rocket (uhh) in his in his (stutter) butt crack and (uhh) shoots that off and he gets burnt really bad. 

(umm) It's not a movie for children. It's rated R. (umm) It's got dangerous stunts and (uhh) a lot of language and nudity. So it's really not for kids and if you insist on having a kid watch it, you should probably have a parent present. 

(uhh) Anyways, Jackass The Movie, special collector's edition, I really recommend it.
