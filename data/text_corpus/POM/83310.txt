Kickin' It Old School is (uhh) movie about a kid who is very interested in break dancing and (uhh) 

given in his childhood days he gets into an accident 

and 

while break dancing itself 

and he goes into a coma for twenty years. 

(umm) He wakes up twenty years later and (uhh)

he finds out that he's still kid but with that and also he xxx that dream of making it big in breaking dance in the break dance industry so 

he regroups his friends and they enter a competition (umm)

and (umm) the movie goes on from there there is also this girl who is 

who is so interested in him (uhh) 

(umm) same thing I mean (uhh) 

the rivals from his childhood is again the same rival and (uhh) 

the whole movie is about how he win the xxx and how he wins the whole competition so 

the 

I mean 

the plot plot (stutter) sounds just okay but the movie is 

utterly disappointing I mean I did not really enjoy the movie a lot 

basically because of (umm) the fact that you know xxx
