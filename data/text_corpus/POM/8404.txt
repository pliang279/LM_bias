Hi, my name is Jordan and I'm gonna be reviewing the movie the DVD, Gladiator. 

Now this movie came out

(uhh) a while back and before I saw it I really thought it was just gonna be a straight gore 

(uhh) flick. I thought it was just gonna have lots of 

(umm) lots of blood, lots of violence and that's all it was gonna be about. Well it turns out this movie's actually really really good. It has a great storyline, the actors were great, there was nothing bad about this movie. I enjoyed every bit of it.

Sometimes it can be a little bit long, but 

(umm) it really was a great movie. It has 

(umm) lots of action sequences in it. It does have a lot of blood and gore and stuff but it also has a great storyline. So

(umm) Ridley Scott

(umm) directed this movie and he did a great job. Everything in this movie is great. I would recommend it to anyone who likes action movies who doesn't mind seeing a little blood and gore and things like that. But 

(umm) it has a great story, it even has a little bit of a love story for you know, the ladies. So

(umm) yep. But if you enjoy action movies I would definitely 

(uhh) think about picking this one up.
