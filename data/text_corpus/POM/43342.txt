Hi. This movie that I'm going to review for you is the new movie Borat that recently just came out on DVD. This movie stars Sacha Baron Cohen and he plays the character called Borat who is supposed to be a man from the country Kazakhstan who has come to America to make a documentary about American life and American customs. 

(umm) But 

the movie is really Sacha Baron Cohen dressed up as this character going around America and (umm) interviewing real people basically, and getting their responses to somebody kind of 

from a different culture, (umm) more of a third world country. It's

kind of (umm)

he portrays Kazakhstan as a country, you know, where women are pretty degraded and (umm) 

they don't really have cars and (umm) 

running water. It's pretty third world but the movie is absolutely hilarious. Especially people's real life reactions to this (umm) 

to Sacha Baron Cohen playing this character. (umm)

And throughout the movie he, Borat, the character, (umm) becomes obsessed with Pamela Anderson and so that's when he decides that he wants to go from New York City to California

to meet Pamela Anderson and marry her. So it's basically Borat going across the country talking to different people, going to different social events, from New York all the way to California

and it is really, really funny. And I think that if you have a good sense of humor you should watch it because you won't be able to stop laughing.
