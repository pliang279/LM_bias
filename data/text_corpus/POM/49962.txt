Hey y'all, how's it going? My name is Jordan and (uhh) today I'm going to be reviewing the DVD Someone Like You. Now this is another chick flick DVD. This isn't one that you're going to want to watch with a bunch of guys or anything like that. Ladies if you're gonna rent this and bring it over to your boyfriend's house and watch it with him then he's not going to be too excited. And guys if you're looking in Blockbuster and you're thinking about a movie to get don't get this one. (umm) The girls might like it but you will suffer for renting this. (umm) But girls

this is right up your alley, you'll really enjoy this. It's one of those romantic comedies, let's find the right guy for this girl kind of movie. (umm) Pretty good, you know, I mean for a chick flick it's okay but guys you're not really going to enjoy it, just expect to be bored. (umm)

But yeah. So as far as (uhh) special features go

expect to be bored also. There aren't any special features on here. They have the theatrical trailer, they count motion menus as (uhh) special feature. I don't know why people do that. On the little special features column they say moving menus. That's not a big deal, I mean people make (stutter) moving menus all the time. I don't know why they do that, it makes me crazy. But (umm), so yeah, not a lot of special features here. So (umm) so I guess this is a whole if you're a girl you're really gonna like this, but if you're a guy you're definitely gonna to just want to step on this a lot. So (umm)

so yeah, that's about it. This is Someone Like You, and (umm)

yeah, so that's it.
