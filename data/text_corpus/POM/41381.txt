Hi, my name is Anaj and today I'm reviewing the movie Boxing Helena. (umm)

It's a psychological thriller, if you haven't watched it it's a nice movie.  It's about this doctor who's kind of psychologically

(uhh) crazy. He's really generous, you know, really rich, but he wants this girl who's kind of a seductress and (uhh) well the movie's R rated. It has some (uhh) adult scenes in it with them. And (uhh) it's an alright movie, I didn't like the acting of the guy (uhh) Julian Sands and Sherilyn Fenn so the acting was just alright. (uhh) A onetime movie, definitely not my type though. It it (stutter) is a thriller (umm)

he wants this woman, the woman is you know

not interested in the guy so he finds a 

(uhh), I won't tell the story but he gets possession of this girl and then tries to take care and win her heart over, but 

(uhh) the story's (uhh) related to that. Watch this movie (umm) one time see, not bad. DVD (uhh) I'm not sure if you'd want it in your collection, I won't suggest it though. (uhh) Not many special features either. (umm) It's more of an artsy kind of movie than a real thriller and (umm) xxx rate it two out of five and

this is a review of the DVD of Boxing Helena.
