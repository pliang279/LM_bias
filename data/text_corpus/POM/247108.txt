Hello expotv, this is Dugan and I'm reviewing the movie Three-Hundred. And this is an excellent movie. (umm)

It is very driving, very fast, and very bloody. (umm) If you can't handle blood then don't watch it, but if you can then it is very inspiring and (umm) many women like it because of the very strong men. {laugh} Naked, almost, men. And {laugh} the men like it because there is lots of violence and strength and all that. So it's (umm)

a great movie, we watched it before basketball games and it's like (uhh) (umm) it's an inspiration kind of to us. It would (umm) get us more excited for the game.

(umm) And what it's about is it's it's (stutter) about King Leonidas leading (uhh) his army of three-hundred Spartans who are supposedly the best warriors in the world, he is leading them against the great Persian army and against King Xerxes. And

it's a great movie, great ending, great plot, everything.

I like it a lot, the only problem is if you don't like the gore then you probably shouldn't watch it. And it's not recommendable for anybody under about

fourteen or fifteen. It's pretty,

it's pretty (uhh) gruesome so. It's a good movie though. Thank you.
