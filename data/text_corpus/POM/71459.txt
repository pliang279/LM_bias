Hi, ExpoTV. This is user QTPie. I'm reviewing a movie starring the hottest guy in the world. And many of you girls out there who are at, do ExpoTV probably know this, but it's Bill Murray, right? He's so hot. This movie is Groundhog Day. And it's a romance movie. It's starring Bill Murray and this other girl. I think she's on (umm) Seinfeld. I don't know, though. That looks like her, right, from Seinfeld?

She's a really good actress, and this movie is hilarious. (stutter) Of course it is. I mean, it's got Bill Murray, right? This movie is PG-thirteen, though. It's made by Columbia Pictures. And basically what this movie is about is, like, every day, Bill Murray wakes up and it's like a different time period. Or, no, every day he wakes up and it's the same day that keeps going on and on in every piece. Every day, he goes to sleep and it's the same day after that. But (stutter) him and this girl fall in love every day and they always forget until he breaks the spell. And it's a good movie. I recommend it.
