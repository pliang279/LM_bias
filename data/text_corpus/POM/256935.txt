Hey Expo tv this is my video review of the movie 

ten thousand B.C.

(umm)

If you know anything about the director you know he directed Independence Day,

and he also I believe directed The Patriot.

Both those movies

were excellent and I think ninety-nine percent of the population will agree with you on that. However,

if you're like me and you use that to say, hey, let's go see ten thousand B.C. it's by that guy who directed Independence Day. You're going to be highly disappointed. This movie is horrible. It's about these like people just running around doing pointless stuff

that you don't care about. {cough} I would almost describe it as like a reality tv show from ten thousand B.C. like I don't care

about this guy running around in the jungle.

I just want this to end. {cough} There's really like, I didn't (stutter) catch too much of a plot like there's like (umm) there's this little plot that's stupid.

The movie has no substance.

It's not interesting, it's not gonna hold your attention. And it is really long, like I don't know I don't know (stutter) the exact minutes or anything but

I would say it's got to be close to two hours long and that is.

For a movie that sucks this bad, two hours is way too much, so.

{cough} I don't know I mean,

you can rent this movie and just fast forward it through the boring parts but, I think you would miss about an hour and a half of the movie if you did that. And I'm not going to necessarily say that's a bad thing.

So this is ten thousand B.C.

If you're really into like,

old things that suck,

I would recommend this movie fully to you. But for everyone else

I really think this is a giant miss of a movie from a great director

who I'm not even sure if I can say he's great anymore because he did this movie.

(umm) I would just go pop Independence Day {cough} watch that a few times and then call it a night. Big thumbs down for ten thousand B.C.
