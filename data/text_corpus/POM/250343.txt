Hi my name is Aned and today I'm reviewing the movie Meet the Spartans. (uhh) Now this movie is something like Scary Movie, (uhh) you know getting, taking together all these scenes from different movies and kind of making fun of it. So the main focus is on three hundred here or the (uhh) all the (stutter) Leonidas and (uhh) you know the brave men here, the, there's (stutter) all these muscular guys and (uhh) leather underwear or whatnot. And (uhh) there's a whole bunch of army that (uhh) you know, they're (stutter) invading Persians and (uhh) includes (uhh) let's say Paris Hilton, (stutter) Rocky Balboa, ghost riders, so many things that (uhh) they have come together with and made fun of it. Now I'm particularly not a very big fan either of scary movies or meet the spartans, I just went to kind of watch this movie just to see if it's fun enough. Well as it turns out, (uhh) it was very cheesy comedy, very corny and I

generally don't prefer this such kind of movies. So I'll just rate this two on four in fact even the (uhh) I've talked to other people they didn't like this movie either. (uhh) But you know if you like those kind of movies if you're a fan of scary movie one two three, (uhh)

Maybe you know, go to theaters watch it maybe you'll kind of like it. (uhh) But Meet the Spartans, two on five, and (uhh) not as comical as I thought it would be.
