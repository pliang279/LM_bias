Napoleon Dynamite.

(uhh) If you don't, and you haven't heard of this movie, I don't know where you've been living. Maybe in a friggin rock because Napoleon Dynamite is, I almost wanna say a cult classic. Yeah, originally bought by MTV and 

(umm) (uhh) when MTV's scouting for new and upcoming films they wanna present, Napoleon Dynamite was found. 

(uhh) They tell you about it in the extras of this DVD, so it's a great way to find out about the history and how Napoleon Dynamite came to be.

So I don't need to go into depth about what Napoleon Dynamite's about because 

(umm) you should already know.

(umm) My lips hurt real bad, can I have some of your chap stick?

Or (uhh) give me some your tots. Or

Sweet. Or, well you get the point. Eat your food Tina.

Gosh.

Just some imitations of Napoleon Dynamite if that's what you want. Because if you wanna laugh and you wanna just see just an idiot up there. You want a movie to quote or if you never understood the quotes coming from Napoleon Dynamite, and maybe you feel left out, then 

you gotta see this movie and maybe you won't feel so left out when people talk about sweet Napoleon jokes, alright?

Gosh.
