So, America, I got a DVD to show you today. And it is The Italian Job

(umm) released by

Paramount Pictures. Awesome movie. And it features Mark Wahlberg, Charlize Theron, Edward, and Edward Norton.

(umm) Really good movie (uhh) action packed (umm)

you know, all the good stuff and (uhh) I mean, Ebert and Roper give it two thumbs up.

Really, really entertaining movie. (umm)

It's got a lot of special features on the DVD too.

It's got (umm) the making of it (umm)

driving schools, which show you how they used the Mini Cooper in the movie, which was really cool.

(umm) They have deleted scenes, stunts from the movie, (uhh) the wide-screen version, just a whole bunch of really cool stuff, plus the awesome movie.

So definitely pick up The Italian Job because it's a great movie.
