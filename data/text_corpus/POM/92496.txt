Hey, 

(uhh) this is a review of

Are We Done Yet which is a (uhh)

(uhh)

abysmal movie starring (uhh) 

ice cube. It was (uhh) 

it was a pain to sit through really it was 

it was kinda a mystery that it was 

was made you know. There was probably a lot better movies that

get passed up but

this

somehow made it. (umm) It 

feels like about half a movie should've been cut which would be kinda a short film but (uhh) 

probably would've been easy to sit through. (uhh) 

The trailer was pretty funny but (uhh)

don't be misled. It was

it was terrible. (uhh) 

Don't waste your time, I

give it a one out of five for not being funny

although ice cube is pretty cool.
