Hi. (umm) I'm reviewing the DVD release of Liberty Stands Still. It (uhh) stars Linda Fiorentino, Wesley Snipes, and Oliver Platt. (umm)

The movie is an hour and a half long. (uhh)

The only special features on here are a half hour of alternate camera angles, which not very interesting, and (uhh)

a couple of splitscreen scenes which is kind of cool to watch, and production commentary, which I guess if you're interested in that kind of thing (uhh) you might enjoy. (uhh) the movie itself I thought was pretty bad. (umm)

This woman Linda Fiorentino plays an heiress to a gun manufacturer and while she's out on the street she gets a phone call and realizes that a sniper has her in her sights and (uhh) it's a lot like Phone Booth if you've seen that but really not as good. So (uhh)

the DVD release it's got some unique special features, I don't really know if I'd call them good. The movie itself is (uhh) not so good.
