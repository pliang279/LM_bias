Hi. Today I'm presenting a movie opinion on the DVD office Space. 

This movie gets a ten out of ten from me, it's a great comedy. 

(umm) It's about this guy who hates his job, he works in like (uhh) 

like tech company and he works in a cubicle all day, and his boss

sucks and so he one day he gets hypnotized and the hypnosis guy pretty much convinces him that he shouldn't care about life. So he just does whatever he wants, goes to work when he wants, does what he wants at all times. And there's all these funny things going on, the other characters make it really funny too. (umm)

So definitely use (uhh) get (stutter) or rent Office Space. It's a great DVD. (umm) 

It didn't really go big in theaters so you may not have heard of it, but it's really big on DVD. 

(uhh) It also has this other character named Milton in it who is hilarious, and

the (stutter) the DVD also has like special bloopers and deleted scenes and DVD commentary. 

So go rent or buy Office Space the DVD.
