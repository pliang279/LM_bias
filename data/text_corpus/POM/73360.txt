Hi everyone today i'm going to give you my Expo review on this DVD called Elf and it stars Will Ferrell.

It's a light comedy about a human that

(umm) got raised by elves and than went back to

earth or what not or the city and try to find his dad and bring back Christmas which was kind of lost in the city

(uhh) It's a really good comedy

it's a Christmas movie but you definitely could watch it when it's not Christmas I watched it in the summer time and it's still really funny

(umm) Will Ferrell plays a really good role as this little elf guy

and (umm) there's a few good songs in it

and I kind of like it's not to long it's really easy to watch, it's a little bit over an hour

(umm) this is the full screen version but it also comes in a wide screen version

and you can get it at any place that sells DVD's Target or Best Buy it's probably under ten dollars.

So definitely check it out and it's called elf, thanks.
