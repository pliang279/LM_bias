Hey, this is a (uhh) review of Hot Fuzz

which

is, I think, still in theaters and (uhh)

{sigh} stars the two gentlemen from

(uhh) Shaun of the Dead and it's, it's (stutter) very similar. If you liked (uhh) Shaun of the Dead

you'll like

Hot Fuzz, and if you've never seen Shaun of the Dead you probably should because it will change your life. (umm)

It's

well kind of mocking action movies is actually does a better job

than many action movies do, just

by not being completely ridiculous.

And (uhh) it's got a good story,

it's got (uhh) good special effects, it's got great characters.

You actually care about them. (umm) 

Yeah, it's definitely a movie that you need to see. (uhh)

I give it five out of five and I'll buy it on DVD when it hopefully comes out.
