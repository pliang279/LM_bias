Hey expo Tv. Today I am going to talk about another summer movie that is currently in theaters. Vicky Cristina Barcelona.

(umm) xxx seen this with a few of my friends and I was much more soft having done so (umm) this film has little substance. It's a Woody Allen film strangely enough which you would think that it would have some substance but not this one

(umm) with some big name actors Javier Bardem (umm) Scarlett Johansson and Penelope Cruz all on this film. And basically what it is, I will give you the basic plot Penelope Cruz, her character and Scarlett Johansson's character

(umm) travel to Barcelona (umm) and there you know they are alone and they are young females. Basically there they just have (umm) relations with Javier Bardem's character (umm)

and he's still involved with with his wife so it's kinda like a love quadrangle not a triangle cause there's three of them and one guy so quadrangle (umm) that's about as deep as the plot gets (umm) they try to do some cheesy plot development and cheesy character development. It doesn't really work.

There's a little bit of humor in the film

(umm) I think Woody Allen has an interesting sense of humor, a very dry sense of humor. That I think worked with the film

(umm) but originality wise, this movie is nothing that hasn't been made before It's just kinda sleezy (umm) waste of time completes your mind type of thing. Not a family film by any means not a children's film by any means

(umm) so I would not recommend (umm)Vicky Christina Barcelona at (umm) at any case scenario don't waste your time don't waste your money don't pollute your mind not a good film one out of five stars thumbs down.
