Hi. I am here to review a movie that is currently in theaters called Boarding Gate. They should call it boring gate because that's really what it is. It's basically a waste of your time. The premise of this story is that there's an ex-prostitute Sandra, living in London and after an encounter with one of her ex's. The whole xxx and xxx thing going on which ends in violence. She is forced to flee from England to Hong Kong.

Now in Hong Kong she meets people she thinks are her friends, they promise to help her out and get her all her papers and her visas and all that and

drugs are involved and are these people are friends after all? Or is it just a whole big manipulative thing? The plot line is pretty empty. (umm) I talked to some of my friends that seen it and they were also just not impressed. So if you have a couple of hours that you just want to waste and I mean waste, then go check it out. Have a good day. Bye.
