Hi there my name is Nalin and this is a review of the movie The Italian Job. This movie is now on dvds. (uhh) It's been a while since it's been on dvds but (uhh) I'm reviewing it now. So (uhh) The movie has got Mark Wahlberg and Charlize Theron in the lead role. And other people too because it's basically about a

group of con artists who

(uhh) carry out of, carry out flawless plans. Not just one but they been carrying out many plans (uhh) for a long time and (uhh)

so it's basically about this team and (uhh) we start out with seeing (uhh) one of their con jobs. And (uhh) how one of the members in the

team itself betrays other members. And then the whole movie setup is (uhh) the other members taking revenge from this (uhh) guy who betrayed them. Now the thing is it's, it's not about the money, The revenge it's much more than that. And that makes it nice. (uhh) The movie is cool, it's (uhh) fast and something's always happening so there was no boring moment. (uhh) Not the smartest movie, if you're a person who enjoys smart movies you might not like it but I liked it. And (uhh)

(uhh) that's just my personal choice in movies. So it's a fast, fast movie and it's (uhh) hyped up it's got a lot of (uhh) star and everything. It's a cool movie and (uhh) I rate (uhh) The Italian Job five out of five.
