Hello there Expo TV viewers, (umm) my name is Karl and I'm reviewing Ironman, (uhh), the film today. I went to go see it the other night, and it was a lot different than I expected. I expected it to be

more of a superhero movie than it was. (umm), I really liked it though, I thought I thought (stutter) it did a great job. (umm), It was sort of political which I wasn't unsuspecting, but welcomed. (umm) It follows Tony Stark who is (umm) the head of Stark industries, which is a weapons manufacturer. (umm) This is all fictional of course. (uhh) and, (umm), it's it's (stutter) based on the Marvel comic of the same name Ironman and, (umm), Tony (uhh) gets capture by some (umm), Afghani militants and he, they, they (stutter) force him to build this weapon, and he sort of secretly behind their backs builds this Iron Man suit, (umm), and just bursts out of there and decides that he should really be using his weapons (umm), for good instead of, sort of, just for killing purposes.

(uhh) This was overall a very, very good movie. It was sort of long. It was like two and a half hours long. (umm) But there's a little bit of a love story in it. There's (umm)

a lot of, there's not a lot of action but there's a fair amount of action. There's some really cool scenes where (umm), he's in a suit and doing his Ironman things, and he's got like all that cool gadgets that (umm) he's got on there. And there's a lot of like technical sciency stuff in there too if you're into that. So, overall I thought it was a really good movie. (umm) So if you're interested in (umm), superheros type stuff (umm) go see Ironman. And if you're not, then, there's probably something in this movie for you anyways. Alright, till next time.
