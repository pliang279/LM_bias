Hey 

(uhh) This is a review of Pathfinder which 

(umm) you've probably seen the trailer. It was 

awesome, and 

(uhh) very misleading. (uhh) You see the trailer was awesome but the movie 

(umm) was terrible. It was 

(uhh) it was terrible. 

(umm) The story 

was not 

(uhh) not up to par and the acting was pretty lackluster. 

(uhh) The CG, FX fight scenes all that, 

they were good but it wasn't enough to save the movie at all.

(umm) But yeah it was, it was

(umm) pretty bad 

show on their part.

(umm) I would avoid it.

It's 

it's (stutter) not entertaining at all. 

(umm) I'd give it a 

(uhh) one out of five if I could. 

I guess

probably closer to a zero, but I guess it rounds up. So yes,

terrible.
