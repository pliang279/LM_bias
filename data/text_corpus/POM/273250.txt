Hello, my name is Mike, and today I'll be talking to you about the movie Traitor, which I went and saw last night. As formality, here is my movie ticket.

And there it went.

So, Traitor is a movie about (uhh), it's a basic spy movie. The premise here is really not good in any way, shape, or form. But I will try to hack it together for you. So, this (uhh), sort of, straight-laced FBI dude is investigating (uhh), a bunch of crazy stuff that happened. And it turns out that this other sort of counter intelligence dude for the US, (uhh) is always seems to be connected to all of it. So, it's, he has to figure out what's going on and why this is happening and is person number two involved with this, and is he a good guy or a bad guy, is the people is coming to help him investigate and are they good or bad is there other interests in here.

That's the premise. It's a really bad spy movie cause it really feels like there's no real story to it. There's the investigation element, but that's it. You know, what's the story, what's the point. There is none. That's the flaw of this movie. The script was written as sort of a, sub-element. You know, it's missing the greater story to which the script plugs in to. And, that's why I can't give this movie anything more than a one out of five, cause it was atrocious.

And this isn't worth seeing at all, cause I mean, come on, you can come up with better spy movies than this. There are so many. And I mean, not necessarily like spy like, James Bond, but counter, like you know, investigation spy movies. There are so many better ones to be doing.

So, I have to say, one out of five. This was horrible. The premise is barely there at all.  It's like a quarter of a movie but running the full length. Which is bad because the actors do a good job, but that cannot save it from being an atrocious pile of junk. So, one out five for Traitor. Thank you and good night, and don't see it.
