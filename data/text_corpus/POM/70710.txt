Hello I am Jenny and I am here to tell about You Got Served.

It's a dancing video.

I don't think it's that good 

it's a special edition 

and it's ninety-five minutes long,

not really worth the ninety-five minutes as Kevin xxx in it xxx  

and (uhh) 

I don't know, they dance all wacky, they pretty good I mean, if I can dance like that,

I want to be in a movie

but it's about hip hop dancing and their stomp I guess and it has special features

and {sigh} the making of you got served feature and it has preview on it too but, I don't know why they put a preview on a DVD but, they did.

It has subtitles in English and French 

and it also has 

not one comedian on it xxx I can't find it but, it has comedian on it but xxx pretty funny on TV a lot.

It has scantly dressed women which men might like so,

anyways you can watch it but I really xxx.
