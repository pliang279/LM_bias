So the movie I'm going to review for you today is Pretty Woman. 

It stars Richard Gere 

and Julia Roberts. 

And this DVD is the fifteenth anniversary edition, 

so it has some extra features on it. 

This story 

well, this video actually came out in the early nineties and 

it's (umm) the story of a girl who is a hooker. 

Julia Roberts. 

And she gets picked up 

by a wealthy man named Richard Gere, 

and he doesn't actually plan on 

(umm) 

picking up a hooker. 

(umm) But he does 

(umm) when he's looking for directions and something happens that both of them (stutter) don't expect which is that they fall in love 

and 

(umm) she kind of learns that there's more that she wants to life than being a prostitute. 

And he learns that there's more to life than 

being a wealthy businessman. 

And 

I love this movie, it's one of those classic chick flicks. 

And (umm) 

it's just, 

oh it makes you another movie that makes you just so happy at the end. (umm) 

And it's definitely a movie that you should watch with your girlfriends ladies 

(umm) cuz it's just fun. 

So that's Pretty Woman with Richard Gere and Julia Roberts.
