Hi expotv land, it's me Danny Ericson, and I'm here to talk to you about the movie currently in theaters Ten-Thousand BC. (umm) You've probably seen the previews for this cause it's a pretty (umm)

widespread movie in its advertising and it has a lot of epic looking scenes but pretty much that's all it is. (umm)

And I would say (stutter) don't watch it. It's (umm) starring Steven Strait, Camilla Belle, Cliff Curtis, Omar Shariffe, and Tim Barlow. So a bunch of people that you've probably never heard of so there's no real star appeal in the movie for one thing. (umm) The,

the movie just really doesn't have a lot of substance to it as you can guess. If you're just looking for kind of a

escapist movie where you just, where (umm)

you're it's not set in this time or date (umm) it (stutter) may be a good (stutter) movie for you to watch but I don't think it's very re-watchable since the plot is pretty paper thin, and it's just really not a movie you can watch more than once. (umm)

The digital effects are great but (umm) I would say that it's not worth much more than that.
