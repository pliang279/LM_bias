Hey guys I'm here with a review of one of best movies ever made,

Oldboy.

(umm) It's a Korean movie based off of the

the Japanese mange

(umm) and it's (uhh) directed by (uhh) 

what's his name, Park Chan-wook. 

(umm) It's probably the toughest movie ever.

(uhh) It's about a man who gets imprisoned for fifteen years

(umm) and and (stutter) this this (stutter) prison is like a business where people can like have people held for as long as they pay them for. So

(umm) he's trying to find out who paid to have him imprisoned.

And there's lots of twists.

(uhh) Really tough fight scenes.

(umm) Great acting, great story, just everything about it is pretty much perfect.

(stutter) Totally five star movie.

(umm) Very violent. Very just it's probably the best revenge movie ever made.

(umm) It, I definitely recommend you see Oldboy.
