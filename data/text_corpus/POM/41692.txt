I'm reviewing the dvd Chasing Liberty. 

Chasing Liberty is about a girl named Anna who is the president's only daughter. 

(umm) Anna is tired of always being followed around by secret service agents and she really wants to have some fun and 

enjoy her freedom before she goes to college. 

While she's on a trip with her parents she meets a boy and they sneak off and travel all over Europe together, 

and eventually she finds out that 

the boy had been lying to her all this time and he was really a secret service agent himself. 

So by this time Anna has of course fallen in love with him. 

But after some ups and downs she eventually gets over the fact that he lied to her and realizes that he really did love her. 

(uhh) This wasn't a horrible movie, it was just too much like every other teenage romantic movie. 

If you like chick flicks it's pretty good, the actors and actresses aren't bad and the storyline is kind of cute. 

But it was just kind of cliche. 

But if you're looking for a cute chick flick you'd probably enjoy Chasing Liberty.
