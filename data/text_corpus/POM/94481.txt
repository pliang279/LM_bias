Hey (uhh) this is a review of three hundred, 

which I think at this point (umm) 

probably be ninety percent of America has seen. 

And with good reason, it is 

(uhh) monumental. It's epic. 

It's (uhh) 

it's amazing. (umm) 

The the (stutter) battles, 

is, they're perfect. (uhh) 

The CG is perfect it's 

pretty amazing 

what they can do nowadays. It's it's (stutter) inspirational 

will change your life. (umm) 

But yeah it's got a good story. 

It's got good characters. 

It's got pretty much everything you ever need 

including you know gore 

with the story. 

(uhh) But it gives you a little 

kind of a taste of history. 

(umm) Yeah very enjoyable 

see it buy it. 

Five out of five.
