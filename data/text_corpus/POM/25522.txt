Right now I'm going to be reviewing

The Descent.

The (uhh) movie came out last summer and I watched it recently and I feel that it was 

kind of a lackluster effort by the 

(uhh) people who made this movie.

Basically it's  about a group of women who annually go on an adventure. This year they decide to 

go exploring some 

(uhh) underground caves and 

(uhh) they get lost due to a cave in 

and proceed to be attacked by some weird kind of 

creatures.

The movie is really fast paced, kind of lacks a plot.

There's a little twist at the end, which I didn't really care for

and had a little trouble understanding

and seemed a little disjointed there at the very end. 

I give it a two out of five.
