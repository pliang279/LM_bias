Hi, my name's Rob, I'm reviewing the movie Serenity 

on DVD.

This is a movie that's 

a spinoff of the 

series Firefly that was cancelled on Fox.

(umm) The story is five-hundred years into the future 

where a 

gang of, 

I guess you could call them pirates, 

are battling the evil alliance 

that has control of the universe.

It stars Nathan Fillion, 

Adam Baldwin and 

(stutter) Summer Glau.

Let's see the feature, 

the special features include twenty minutes of deleted scenes, 

outtakes, 

and a documentary called Relighting the Firefly. 

It's the story of how (stutter) the television show 

had such a following that 

it became a 

(umm) motion picture. 

It's rated PG-thirteen. Thanks for watching my review.
