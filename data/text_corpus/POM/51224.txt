This is (umm) The Python, the movie The Python 

and (uhh) it's a story about (umm) a doctor, really like a mad scientist, who (umm)

develops (uhh) the perfect killing machine and it's (uhh) a python. 

Engineered the perfect killing machine, the world's first massive genetically enhanced python,

and the actors are, let's see

(uhh) Jerry McCarthy, Will Wheaton, (uhh) Frayne Rosanoff, Casper (stutter) Van Dien, and Robert Englund.

Anyway (umm)

if you like snake movies then you'll this. If you like the Anaconda and all those other snake movies you'll like this. If you don't like snakes, you will not like this.

And (uhh) let's see.

this particular DVD

has outtakes, (uhh) still gallery on pythons, 

(uhh) biographies on the cast and director, trailers,

(uhh) the

the English

and Spanish

subtitles,

so (umm), you know I didn't care for it. I mean I don't know if you can see the picture on this but (stutter) that python's got some huge fangs and (umm)

so if you like snake movies, you would like this. If not, I'd skip this. 

Oh, you can get this at Amazon dot com or rent it from (umm)

Blockbuster. I think it sells for probably under ten dollars at Amazon dot com.
