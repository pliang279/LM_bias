Hi this is Dan with my review of Eight Legged Freaks on DVD. 

And I hadn't even heard about this movie until I actually saw it on tv once and I thought man, 

that is the worst movie I'd ever seen what is it. 

And I finally dug it up and discovered 

Eight Legged Freaks. 

From the producers 

of Independence Day and Godzilla. 

Independence Day and Godzilla this movie is not. Basically it, 

(stutter) the prime attraction here is that it stars that Dewey guy from, 

(uhh) not Scary Movie but (uhh) 

Scream. 

And he is 

I think the 

cop of a town again. 

But the town is basically infested with giant spiders. 

Hence the name Eight Legged Freaks and the little boy 

who's a little nerdy 

and you know, does the science fair thing, (stutter) you know, is all of a sudden the master 

of all these arachnids that are terrorizing the town. 

It's like dead rising, 

the computer game, the video game on Xbox three-sixty with the zombies 

(uhh) meets (uhh) 

arachnids, these spiders. And 

(umm) basically they're all in the mall and these things are attacking and 

seriously I thought I was playing a video game. 

Definitely not fun when you're not playing a video game and attacking everything yourself, 

but watching other people get spun into cocoons, eaten, 

and (uhh) maybe some of these spiders getting attacked. So, 

one out of five stars is my opinion of this movie, do not rent it, do not buy it. 

It's rated PG-thirteen for sci-fi violence, 

brief sexuality and language. 

But definitely not worth your time. 

This is Dan and my review of Eight Legged Freaks
